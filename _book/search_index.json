It can check the structure\nof your data (e.g. all rows have the same number of columns), and its contents\n(e.g. all dates are valid).\n1.1. Features\n\nStructural checks: Ensure that there are no empty rows, no blank headers, etc.\nContent checks: Ensure that the values have the correct types (\"string\", \"number\", \"date\", etc.), that their format is valid (\"string must be an e-mail\"), and that they respect the constraints (\"age must be a number greater than 18\").\nSupport for multiple tabular formats: CSV, Excel files, LibreOffice, Data Package, etc.\nParallelized validations for multi-table datasets\nCommand line interface\n\n1.2.

Running on Python\nfrom goodtables import validate\n\nreport = validate('invalid.csv')\nreport['valid'] # false\nreport['table-count'] # 1\nreport['error-count'] # 3\nreport['tables'][0]['valid'] # false\nreport['tables'][0]['source'] # 'invalid.csv'\nreport['tables'][0]['errors'][0]['code'] # 'blank-header'\n\nYou can read a more in depth explanation on using goodtables with Python on\nthe developer documentation section. Check also\nthe examples folder for other examples.\n1.4. Validation\n1.4.1. Basic checks\nThe basic checks can't be disabled, as they deal with goodtables being able to read the files.\n\n\n\ncheck\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nio-error\nData reading error because of IO error.\n\n\nhttp-error\nData reading error because of HTTP error.\n\n\nsource-error\nData reading error because of not supported or inconsistent contents.\n\n\nscheme-error\nData reading error because of incorrect scheme.\n\n\nformat-error\nData reading error because of incorrect format.\n\n\nencoding-error\nData reading error because of an encoding problem.\n\n\n\n1.4.2. Structural checks\nThese checks validate that the structure of the file are valid.\n\n\n\ncheck\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nblank-header\nThere is a blank header name. All cells in the header row must have a value.\n\n\nduplicate-header\nThere are multiple columns with the same name. All column names must be unique.\n\n\nblank-row\nRows must have at least one non-blank cell.\n\n\nduplicate-row\nRows can't be duplicated.\n\n\nextra-value\nA row has more columns than the header.\n\n\nmissing-value\nA row has less columns than the header.\n\n\n\n1.4.3. Content checks\nThese checks validate the contents of the file. To use them, you need to pass a Table Schema. If you don't have a schema, goodtables can infer it if you use the infer_schema option.\nIf your schema only covers part of the data, you can use the infer_fields to infer the remaining fields.\nLastly, if the order of the fields in the data is different than in your schema, enable the order_fields option.\n\n\n\ncheck\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nschema-error\nSchema is not valid.\n\n\nnon-matching-header\nThe header's name in the schema is different from what's in the data.\n\n\nextra-header\nThe data contains a header not defined in the schema.\n\n\nmissing-header\nThe data doesn't contain a header defined in the schema.\n\n\ntype-or-format-error\nThe value can’t be cast based on the schema type and format for this field.\n\n\nrequired-constraint\nThis field is a required field, but it contains no value.\n\n\npattern-constraint\nThis field value's should conform to the defined pattern.\n\n\nunique-constraint\nThis field is a unique field but it contains a value that has been used in another row.\n\n\nenumerable-constraint\nThis field value should be equal to one of the values in the enumeration constraint.\n\n\nminimum-constraint\nThis field value should be greater or equal than constraint value.\n\n\nmaximum-constraint\nThis field value should be less or equal than constraint value.\n\n\nminimum-length-constraint\nA length of this field value should be greater or equal than schema constraint value.\n\n\nmaximum-length-constraint\nA length of this field value should be less or equal than schema constraint value.\n\n\n\n1.4.4. Advanced checks\n\n\n\ncheck\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nblacklisted-value\nEnsure there are no cells with the blacklisted values.\n\n\ndeviated-value\nEnsure numbers are within a number of standard deviations from the average.\n\n\nsequential-value\nEnsure numbers are be sequential.\n\n\ntruncated-value\nDetect values that were potentially truncated.\n\n\ncustom-constraint\nDefines a constraint based on the values of other columns (e.g. value * quantity == total).\n\n\n\nblacklisted-value\nSometimes we have to check for some values we don't want to have in out dataset. It accepts following options:\n\n\n\noption\ntype\ndescription\n\n\n\n\ncolumn\nint/str\nColumn number or name\n\n\nblacklist\nlist of str\nList of blacklisted values\n\n\n\nConsider the following CSV file:\nid,name\n1,John\n2,bug\n3,bad\n5,Alex\n\nLet's check that the name column doesn't contain rows with bug or bad:\nfrom goodtables import validate\n\nreport = validate('data.csv', checks=[\n    {'blacklisted-value': {'column': 'id', 'blacklist': ['bug', 'bad']}},\n])\n# error on row 3 with code \"blacklisted-value\"\n# error on row 4 with code \"blacklisted-value\"\n\ndeviated-value\nThis check helps to find outlines in a column containing positive numbers. It accepts following options:\n\n\n\noption\ntype\ndescription\n\n\n\n\ncolumn\nint/str\nColumn number or name\n\n\naverage\nstr\nAverage type, either \"mean\", \"median\" or \"mode\"\n\n\ninterval\nint\nValues must be inside range average ± standard deviation * interval\n\n\n\nConsider the following CSV file:\ntemperature\n1\n-2\n7\n0\n1\n2\n5\n-4\n100\n8\n3\n\nWe use median to get an average of the column values and allow interval of 3 standard deviations. For our case median is 2.0 and standard deviation is 29.73 so all valid values must be inside the [-87.19, 91.19] interval.\nreport = validate('data.csv', checks=[\n    {'deviated-value': {'column': 'temperature', 'average': 'median', 'interval': 3}},\n])\n# error on row 10 with code \"deviated-value\"\n\nsequential-value\nThis checks is for pretty common case when a column should have integers that sequentially increment.  It accepts following options:\n\n\n\noption\ntype\ndescription\n\n\n\n\ncolumn\nint/str\nColumn number or name\n\n\n\nConsider the following CSV file:\nid,name\n1,one\n2,two\n3,three\n5,five\n\nLet's check if the id column contains sequential integers:\nfrom goodtables import validate\n\nreport = validate('data.csv', checks=[\n    {'sequential-value': {'column': 'id'}},\n])\n# error on row 5 with code \"sequential-value\"\n\ntruncated-value\nSome database or spreadsheet software (like MySQL or Excel) could cutoff values on saving. There are some well-known heuristics to find this bad values. See https://github.com/propublica/guides/blob/master/data-bulletproofing.md for more detailed information.\nConsider the following CSV file:\nid,amount,comment\n1,14000000,good\n2,2147483647,bad\n3,32767,bad\n4,234234234,bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbad\n\nTo detect all probably truncated values we could use truncated-value check:\nreport = validate('data.csv', checks=[\n    'truncated-value',\n])\n# error on row 3 with code \"truncated-value\"\n# error on row 4 with code \"truncated-value\"\n# error on row 5 with code \"truncated-value\"\n\ncustom-constraint\nWith Table Schema we could create constraints for an individual field but sometimes it's not enough. With a custom constraint check every row could be checked against given limited python expression in which variable names resolve to column values. See list of available operators. It accepts following options:\n\n  constraint (str)\n  Constraint definition (e.g. col1 + col2 == col3)\n\n\nConsider csv file like this:\nid,name,salary,bonus\n1,Alex,1000,200\n2,Sam,2500,500\n3,Ray,1350,500\n4,John,5000,1000\n\nLet's say our business rule is to be shy on bonuses:\nreport = validate('data.csv', checks=[\n    {'custom-constraint': {'constraint': 'salary > bonus * 4'}},\n])\n# error on row 4 with code \"custom-constraint\"\n\n1.5. Developer documentation\n1.5.1. Semantic versioning\nWe follow the Semantic Versioning specification to define our version\nnumbers. This means that we'll increase the major version number when there's a\nbreaking change. Because of this, we recommend you to explicitly specify the\ngoodtables version on your dependency list (e.g. setup.py or\nrequirements.txt).\n1.5.2. Validate\nGoodtables validates your tabular dataset to find structural and content\nerrors. Consider you have a file named invalid.csv. Let's validate it:\nreport = validate('invalid.csv')\n\nWe could also pass a remote URI instead of a local path. It supports CSV, XLS,\nXLSX, ODS, JSON, and all other formats supported by the tabulator\nlibrary.\nValidation report\nThe output of the validate() method is a report dictionary. It includes\ninformation if the data was valid, count of errors, list of table reports, which\nindividual checks failed, etc.\nResulting report will be looking like this:\n{\n    \"time\": 0.009,\n    \"error-count\": 1,\n    \"warnings\": [\n        \"Table \\\"data/invalid.csv\\\" inspection has reached 1 error(s) limit\"\n    ],\n    \"preset\": \"table\",\n    \"valid\": false,\n    \"tables\": [\n        {\n            \"errors\": [\n                {\n                    \"row-number\": null,\n                    \"message\": \"Header in column 3 is blank\",\n                    \"row\": null,\n                    \"column-number\": 3,\n                    \"code\": \"blank-header\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"error-count\": 1,\n            \"headers\": [\n                \"id\",\n                \"name\",\n                \"\",\n                \"name\"\n            ],\n            \"scheme\": \"file\",\n            \"row-count\": 2,\n            \"valid\": false,\n            \"encoding\": \"utf-8\",\n            \"time\": 0.007,\n            \"schema\": null,\n            \"format\": \"csv\",\n            \"source\": \"data/invalid\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"table-count\": 1\n}\n\nRase report errors are standardized and described\nin\nData Quality Spec.\nThe errors are divided in one of the following categories:\n\nsource - data can't be loaded or parsed\nstructure - general tabular errors like duplicate headers\nschema - error of checks against Table Schema\ncustom - custom checks errors\n\nChecks\nCheck is a main validation actor in goodtables. The list of enabled checks can\nbe changed using checks and skip_checks arguments. Let's explore the options\non an example:\nreport = validate('data.csv') # by default structure and schema (if available) checks\nreport = validate('data.csv', checks=['structure']) # only structure checks\nreport = validate('data.csv', checks=['schema']) # only schema (if available) checks\nreport = validate('data.csv', checks=['bad-headers']) # check only 'bad-headers'\nreport = validate('data.csv', skip_checks=['bad-headers']) # exclude 'bad-headers'\n\nBy default a dataset will be validated against all available Data Quality Spec\nerrors. Some checks can be unavailable for validation. For example, if the\nschema isn't provided, only the structure checks will be done.\nPresets\nGoodtables support different formats of tabular datasets. They're called\npresets. A tabular dataset is some data that can be split in a list of data\ntables, as:\n\nWe can change the preset using the preset argument for validate(). By\ndefault, it'll be inferred from the source, falling back to table. To validate\na data package, we can do:\nreport = validate('datapackage.json') # implicit preset\nreport = validate('datapackage.json', preset='datapackage') # explicit preset\n\nThis will validate all tabular resources in the datapackage.\nIt's also possible to validate a list of files using the \"nested\" preset. To do\nso, the first argument to validate() should be a list of dictionaries, where\neach key in the dictionary is named after a parameter on validate(). For example:\nreport = validate([{'source': 'data1.csv'}, {'source': 'data2.csv'}]) # implicit preset\nreport = validate([{'source': 'data1.csv'}, {'source': 'data2.csv'}], preset='nested') # explicit preset\n\nIs similar to:\nreport_data1 = validate('data1.csv')\nreport_data2 = validate('data2.csv')\n\nThe difference is that goodtables validates multiple tables in parallel, so\ncalling using the \"nested\" preset should run faster.\n1.6. Contributing\nThis project follows the Open Knowledge International coding standards.\nWe recommend you to use virtualenv to isolate goodtables from the rest of the\npackages in your machine.\nTo install goodtables and the development dependencies, run:\n$ make install\nTo run the tests, use:\n$ make test\n\n1.7. FAQ\n1.7.1. How can I add a new custom check?\nTo create a custom check user could use a check decorator. This way the builtin check could be overridden (use the spec error code like duplicate-row) or could be added a check for a custom error (use type, context and position arguments):\nfrom goodtables import validate, check\n\n@check('custom-check', type='custom', context='body')\ndef custom_check(errors, cells, row_number):\n    for cell in cells:\n        errors.append({\n            'code': 'custom-error',\n            'message': 'Custom error',\n            'row-number': row_number,\n            'column-number': cell['number'],\n        })\n        cells.remove(cell)\n\nreport = validate('data.csv', checks=['custom-check'])\n\nFor now this documentation section is incomplete. Please see builtin checks to learn more about checking protocol.\n1.7.2. How can I add support for a new tabular file type?\nTo create a custom preset user could use a preset decorator. This way the builtin preset could be overridden or could be added a custom preset.\nfrom tabulator import Stream\nfrom tableschema import Schema\nfrom goodtables import validate\n\n@preset('custom-preset')\ndef custom_preset(source, **options):\n    warnings = []\n    tables = []\n    for table in source:\n        try:\n            tables.append({\n                'source':  str(source),\n                'stream':  Stream(...),\n                'schema': Schema(...),\n                'extra': {...},\n            })\n        except Exception:\n            warnings.append('Warning message')\n    return warnings, tables\n\nreport = validate(source, preset='custom-preset')\n\nFor now this documentation section is incomplete. Please see builtin presets to learn more about the dataset extraction protocol.\n1.8.

Package\nA class for working with data packages. It provides various capabilities like loading local or remote data package, inferring a data package descriptor, saving a data package descriptor and many more.\nConsider we have some local csv files in a data directory. Let's create a data package based on this data using a Package class:\n\ndata/cities.csv\n\ncity,location\nlondon,\"51.50,-0.11\"\nparis,\"48.85,2.30\"\nrome,\"41.89,12.51\"\n\n\ndata/population.csv\n\ncity,year,population\nlondon,2017,8780000\nparis,2017,2240000\nrome,2017,2860000\n\nFirst we create a blank data package:\npackage = Package()\n\nNow we're ready to infer a data package descriptor based on data files we have. Because we have two csv files we use glob pattern **/*.csv:\npackage.infer('**/*.csv')\npackage.descriptor\n#{ profile: 'tabular-data-package',\n#  resources:\n#   [ { path: 'data/cities.csv',\n#       profile: 'tabular-data-resource',\n#       encoding: 'utf-8',\n#       name: 'cities',\n#       format: 'csv',\n#       mediatype: 'text/csv',\n#       schema: [Object] },\n#     { path: 'data/population.csv',\n#       profile: 'tabular-data-resource',\n#       encoding: 'utf-8',\n#       name: 'population',\n#       format: 'csv',\n#       mediatype: 'text/csv',\n#       schema: [Object] } ] }\n\nAn infer method has found all our files and inspected it to extract useful metadata like profile, encoding, format, Table Schema etc. Let's tweak it a little bit:\npackage.descriptor['resources'][1]['schema']['fields'][1]['type'] = 'year'\npackage.commit()\npackage.valid # true\n\nBecause our resources are tabular we could read it as a tabular data:\npackage.get_resource('population').read(keyed=True)\n#[ { city: 'london', year: 2017, population: 8780000 },\n#  { city: 'paris', year: 2017, population: 2240000 },\n#  { city: 'rome', year: 2017, population: 2860000 } ]\n\nLet's save our descriptor on the disk as a zip-file:\npackage.save('datapackage.zip')\n\nTo continue the work with the data package we just load it again but this time using local datapackage.zip:\npackage = Package('datapackage.zip')\n# Continue the work\n\nIt was onle basic introduction to the Package class. To learn more let's take a look on Package class API reference.\nPackage(descriptor, base_path=None, strict=False, storage=None, **options)\nConstructor to instantiate Package class.\n\ndescriptor (str/dict) - data package descriptor as local path, url or object\nbase_path (str) - base path for all relative paths\nstrict (bool) - strict flag to alter validation behavior. Setting it to True leads to throwing errors on any operation with invalid descriptor\nstorage (str/tableschema.Storage) - storage name like sql or storage instance\noptions (dict) - storage options to use for storage creation\n(exceptions.DataPackageException) - raises error if something goes wrong\n(Package) - returns data package class instance\n\npackage.valid\n\n(bool) - returns validation status. It always true in strict mode.\n\npackage.errors\n\n(Exception[]) - returns validation errors. It always empty in strict mode.\n\npackage.profile\n\n(Profile) - returns an instance of Profile class (see below).\n\npackage.descriptor\n\n(dict) - returns data package descriptor\n\npackage.resources\n\n(Resource[]) - returns an array of Resource instances (see below).\n\npackage.resource_names\n\n(str[]) - returns an array of resource names.\n\npackage.get_resource(name)\nGet data package resource by name.\n\nname (str) - data resource name\n(Resource/None) - returns Resource instances or null if not found\n\npackage.add_resource(descriptor)\nAdd new resource to data package. The data package descriptor will be validated  with newly added resource descriptor.\n\ndescriptor (dict) - data resource descriptor\n(exceptions.DataPackageException) - raises error if something goes wrong\n(Resource/None) - returns added Resource instance or null if not added\n\npackage.remove_resource(name)\nRemove data package resource by name. The data package descriptor will be validated after resource descriptor removal.\n\nname (str) - data resource name\n(exceptions.DataPackageException) - raises error if something goes wrong\n(Resource/None) - returns removed Resource instances or null if not found\n\npackage.infer(pattern=False)\n\nArgument pattern works only for local files\n\nInfer a data package metadata. If pattern is not provided only existent resources will be inferred (added metadata like encoding, profile etc). If pattern is provided new resoures with file names mathing the pattern will be added and inferred. It commits changes to data package instance.\n\npattern (str) - glob pattern for new resources\n(dict) - returns data package descriptor\n\npackage.commit(strict=None)\nUpdate data package instance if there are in-place changes in the descriptor.\n\nstrict (bool) - alter strict mode for further work\n(exceptions.DataPackageException) - raises error if something goes wrong\n(bool) - returns true on success and false if not modified\n\npackage = Package({\n    'name': 'package',\n    'resources': [{'name': 'resource', 'data': ['data']}]\n})\n\npackage.name # package\npackage.descriptor['name'] = 'renamed-package'\npackage.name # package\npackage.commit()\npackage.name # renamed-package\n\npackage.save(target, storage=None, **options)\nSaves this data package to storage if storage argument is passed or saves this data package's descriptor to json file if target arguments ends with .json or saves this data package to zip file otherwise.\n\ntarget (string/filelike) - the file path or a file-like object where the contents of this Data Package will be saved into.\nstorage (str/tableschema.Storage) - storage name like sql or storage instance\noptions (dict) - storage options to use for storage creation\n(exceptions.DataPackageException) - raises if there was some error writing the package\n(bool) - return true on success\n\nIt creates a zip file into file_or_path with the contents of this Data Package and its resources. Every resource which content lives in the local filesystem will be copied to the zip file. Consider the following Data Package descriptor:\n{\n    \"name\": \"gdp\",\n    \"resources\": [\n        {\"name\": \"local\", \"format\": \"CSV\", \"path\": \"data.csv\"},\n        {\"name\": \"inline\", \"data\": [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]},\n        {\"name\": \"remote\", \"url\": \"http://someplace.com/data.csv\"}\n    ]\n}\n\nThe final structure of the zip file will be:\n./datapackage.json\n./data/local.csv\nWith the contents of datapackage.json being the same as returned datapackage.descriptor. The resources' file names are generated based on their name and format fields if they exist. If the resource has no name, it'll be used resource-X, where X is the index of the resource in the resources list (starting at zero). If the resource has format, it'll be lowercased and appended to the name, becoming \"name.format\".\n1.3.2. Resource\nA class for working with data resources. You can read or iterate tabular resources using the iter/read methods and all resource as bytes using row_iter/row_read methods.\nConsider we have some local csv file. It could be inline data or remote link - all supported by Resource class (except local files for in-brower usage of course). But say it's data.csv for now:\ncity,location\nlondon,\"51.50,-0.11\"\nparis,\"48.85,2.30\"\nrome,N/A\n\nLet's create and read a resource. Because resource is tabular we could use resource.read method with a keyed option to get an array of keyed rows:\nresource = Resource({path: 'data.csv'})\nresource.tabular # true\nresource.headers # ['city', 'location']\nresource.read(keyed=True)\n# [\n#   {city: 'london', location: '51.50,-0.11'},\n#   {city: 'paris', location: '48.85,2.30'},\n#   {city: 'rome', location: 'N/A'},\n# ]\n\nAs we could see our locations are just a strings. But it should be geopoints. Also Rome's location is not available but it's also just a N/A string instead of Python None. First we have to infer resource metadata:\nresource.infer()\nresource.descriptor\n#{ path: 'data.csv',\n#  profile: 'tabular-data-resource',\n#  encoding: 'utf-8',\n#  name: 'data',\n#  format: 'csv',\n#  mediatype: 'text/csv',\n# schema: { fields: [ [Object], [Object] ], missingValues: [ '' ] } }\nresource.read(keyed=True)\n# Fails with a data validation error\n\nLet's fix not available location. There is a missingValues property in Table Schema specification. As a first try we set missingValues to N/A in resource.descriptor.schema. Resource descriptor could be changed in-place but all changes should be commited by resource.commit():\nresource.descriptor['schema']['missingValues'] = 'N/A'\nresource.commit()\nresource.valid # False\nresource.errors\n# []\n\nAs a good citiziens we've decided to check out recource descriptor validity. And it's not valid! We should use an array for missingValues property. Also don't forget to have an empty string as a missing value:\nresource.descriptor['schema']['missingValues'] = ['', 'N/A']\nresource.commit()\nresource.valid # true\n\nAll good. It looks like we're ready to read our data again:\nresource.read(keyed=True)\n# [\n#   {city: 'london', location: [51.50,-0.11]},\n#   {city: 'paris', location: [48.85,2.30]},\n#   {city: 'rome', location: null},\n# ]\n\nNow we see that:\n\nlocations are arrays with numeric lattide and longitude\nRome's location is a native JavaScript null\n\nAnd because there are no errors on data reading we could be sure that our data is valid againt our schema. Let's save our resource descriptor:\nresource.save('dataresource.json')\n\nLet's check newly-crated dataresource.json. It contains path to our data file, inferred metadata and our missingValues tweak:\n{\n    \"path\": \"data.csv\",\n    \"profile\": \"tabular-data-resource\",\n    \"encoding\": \"utf-8\",\n    \"name\": \"data\",\n    \"format\": \"csv\",\n    \"mediatype\": \"text/csv\",\n    \"schema\": {\n        \"fields\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"city\",\n                \"type\": \"string\",\n                \"format\": \"default\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"name\": \"location\",\n                \"type\": \"geopoint\",\n                \"format\": \"default\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"missingValues\": [\n            \"\",\n            \"N/A\"\n        ]\n    }\n}\n\nIf we decide to improve it even more we could update the dataresource.json file and then open it again using local file name:\nresource = Resource('dataresource.json')\n# Continue the work\n\nIt was onle basic introduction to the Resource class.

Foreign Keys\nThe library supports foreign keys described in the Table Schema specification. It means if your data package descriptor use resources[].schema.foreignKeys property for some resources a data integrity will be checked on reading operations.\nConsider we have a data package:\nDESCRIPTOR = {\n  'resources': [\n    {\n      'name': 'teams',\n      'data': [\n        ['id', 'name', 'city'],\n        ['1', 'Arsenal', 'London'],\n        ['2', 'Real', 'Madrid'],\n        ['3', 'Bayern', 'Munich'],\n      ],\n      'schema': {\n        'fields': [\n          {'name': 'id', 'type': 'integer'},\n          {'name': 'name', 'type': 'string'},\n          {'name': 'city', 'type': 'string'},\n        ],\n        'foreignKeys': [\n          {\n            'fields': 'city',\n            'reference': {'resource': 'cities', 'fields': 'name'},\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    }, {\n      'name': 'cities',\n      'data': [\n        ['name', 'country'],\n        ['London', 'England'],\n        ['Madrid', 'Spain'],\n      ],\n    },\n  ],\n}\n\nLet's check relations for a teams resource:\nfrom datapackage import Package\n\npackage = Package(DESCRIPTOR)\nteams = package.get_resource('teams')\nteams.check_relations()\n# tableschema.exceptions.RelationError: Foreign key \"['city']\" violation in row \"4\"\n\nAs we could see there is a foreign key violation. That's because our lookup table cities doesn't have a city of Munich but we have a team from there. We need to fix it in cities resource:\npackage.descriptor['resources'][1]['data'].append(['Munich', 'Germany'])\npackage.commit()\nteams = package.get_resource('teams')\nteams.check_relations()\n# True\n\nFixed! But not only a check operation is available. We could use relations argument for resource.iter/read methods to dereference a resource relations:\nteams.read(keyed=True, relations=True)\n#[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Arsenal', 'city': {'name': 'London', 'country': 'England}},\n# {'id': 2, 'name': 'Real', 'city': {'name': 'Madrid', 'country': 'Spain}},\n# {'id': 3, 'name': 'Bayern', 'city': {'name': 'Munich', 'country': 'Germany}}]\n\nInstead of plain city name we've got a dictionary containing a city data. These resource.iter/read methods will fail with the same as resource.check_relations error if there is an integrity issue. But only if relations=True flag is passed.\n1.3.7. Exceptions\nexceptions.DataPackageException\nBase class for all library exceptions. If there are multiple errors it could be read from an exceptions object:\ntry:\n    # lib action\nexcept exceptions.DataPackageException as exception:\n    if exception.multiple:\n        for error in exception.errors:\n            # handle error\n\nexceptions.LoadError\nAll loading errors.\nexceptions.ValidationError\nAll validation errors.\nexceptions.CastError\nAll value cast errors.\nexceptions.RelationError\nAll integrity errors.\nexceptions.StorageError\nAll storage errors.\n1.3.8. CLI\n\nIt's a provisional API. If you use it as a part of other program please pin concrete datapackage version to your requirements file.\n\nThe library ships with a simple CLI:\n$ datapackage infer '**/*.csv'\nData package descriptor:\n{'profile': 'tabular-data-package',\n 'resources': [{'encoding': 'utf-8',\n                'format': 'csv',\n                'mediatype': 'text/csv',\n                'name': 'data',\n                'path': 'data/datapackage/data.csv',\n                'profile': 'tabular-data-resource',\n                'schema': ...}}]}\n\n$ datapackage\nUsage: cli.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...\n\nOptions:\n  --version  Show the version and exit.\n  --help     Show this message and exit.\n\nCommands:\n  infer\n  validate\n\n1.4.

It's highly recommended to specify tableschema version range in your setup/requirements file e.g. tableschema>=1.0,.\n$ pip install tableschema\n\n1.2.2. Examples\nCode examples in this readme requires Python 3.4+ interpreter. You could see even more example in examples directory.\nfrom tableschema import Table\n\n# Create table\ntable = Table('path.csv', schema='schema.json')\n\n# Print schema descriptor\nprint(table.schema.descriptor)\n\n# Print cast rows in a dict form\nfor keyed_row in table.iter(keyed=True):\n    print(keyed_row)\n\n1.3. Documentation\n1.3.1. Table\nA table is a core concept in a tabular data world. It represents a data with a metadata (Table Schema). Let's see how we could use it in practice.\nConsider we have some local csv file. It could be inline data or remote link - all supported by Table class (except local files for in-brower usage of course). But say it's data.csv for now:\ncity,location\nlondon,\"51.50,-0.11\"\nparis,\"48.85,2.30\"\nrome,N/A\n\nLet's create and read a table. We use static Table.load method and table.read method with a keyed option to get array of keyed rows:\ntable = Table('data.csv')\ntable.headers # ['city', 'location']\ntable.read(keyed=True)\n# [\n#   {city: 'london', location: '51.50,-0.11'},\n#   {city: 'paris', location: '48.85,2.30'},\n#   {city: 'rome', location: 'N/A'},\n# ]\n\nAs we could see our locations are just a strings. But it should be geopoints. Also Rome's location is not available but it's also just a N/A string instead of JavaScript null. First we have to infer Table Schema:\ntable.infer()\ntable.schema.descriptor\n# { fields:\n#   [ { name: 'city', type: 'string', format: 'default' },\n#     { name: 'location', type: 'geopoint', format: 'default' } ],\n#  missingValues: [ '' ] }\ntable.read(keyed=True)\n# Fails with a data validation error\n\nLet's fix not available location. There is a missingValues property in Table Schema specification. As a first try we set missingValues to N/A in table.schema.descriptor. Schema descriptor could be changed in-place but all changes sould be commited by table.schema.commit():\ntable.schema.descriptor['missingValues'] = 'N/A'\ntable.schema.commit()\ntable.schema.valid # false\ntable.schema.errors\n# []\n\nAs a good citiziens we've decided to check out schema descriptor validity. And it's not valid! We sould use an array for missingValues property. Also don't forget to have an empty string as a missing value:\ntable.schema.descriptor['missingValues'] = ['', 'N/A']\ntable.schema.commit()\ntable.schema.valid # true\n\nAll good. It looks like we're ready to read our data again:\ntable.read(keyed=True)\n# [\n#   {city: 'london', location: [51.50,-0.11]},\n#   {city: 'paris', location: [48.85,2.30]},\n#   {city: 'rome', location: null},\n# ]\n\nNow we see that:\n\nlocations are arrays with numeric lattide and longitude\nRome's location is a native Python None\n\nAnd because there are no errors on data reading we could be sure that our data is valid againt our schema. Let's save it:\ntable.schema.save('schema.json')\ntable.save('data.csv')\n\nOur data.csv looks the same because it has been stringified back to csv format. But now we have schema.json:\n{\n    \"fields\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"city\",\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"format\": \"default\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"location\",\n            \"type\": \"geopoint\",\n            \"format\": \"default\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"missingValues\": [\n        \"\",\n        \"N/A\"\n    ]\n}\n\nIf we decide to improve it even more we could update the schema file and then open it again. But now providing a schema path:\ntable = Table('data.csv', schema='schema.json')\n# Continue the work\n\nIt was onle basic introduction to the Table class.

It will infer and set Table Schema to table.schema based on table data.\n\nlimit (int) - limit rows samle size\n(dict) - returns Table Schema descriptor\n\ntable.save(target, storage=None, **options)\n\nTo save schema use table.schema.save()\n\nSave data source to file locally in CSV format with , (comma) delimiter\n\ntarget (str) - saving target (e.g. file path)\nstorage (None/str) - storage name like sql or bigquery\noptions (dict) - tabulator or storage options\n(exceptions.TableSchemaException) - raises an error if there is saving problem\n(True/Storage) - returns true or storage instance\n\n1.3.2. Schema\nA model of a schema with helpful methods for working with the schema and supported data. Schema instances can be initialized with a schema source as a url to a JSON file or a JSON object. The schema is initially validated (see validate below). By default validation errors will be stored in schema.errors but in a strict mode it will be instantly raised.\nLet's create a blank schema. It's not valid because descriptor.fields property is required by the Table Schema specification:\nschema = Schema()\nschema.valid # false\nschema.errors\n# []\n\nTo do not create a schema descriptor by hands we will use a schema.infer method to infer the descriptor from given data:\nschema.infer([\n  ['id', 'age', 'name'],\n  ['1','39','Paul'],\n  ['2','23','Jimmy'],\n  ['3','36','Jane'],\n  ['4','28','Judy'],\n])\nschema.valid # true\nschema.descriptor\n#{ fields:\n#   [ { name: 'id', type: 'integer', format: 'default' },\n#     { name: 'age', type: 'integer', format: 'default' },\n#     { name: 'name', type: 'string', format: 'default' } ],\n#  missingValues: [ '' ] }\n\nNow we have an inferred schema and it's valid. We could cast data row against our schema. We provide a string input by an output will be cast correspondingly:\nschema.cast_row(['5', '66', 'Sam'])\n# [ 5, 66, 'Sam' ]\n\nBut if we try provide some missing value to age field cast will fail because for now only one possible missing value is an empty string. Let's update our schema:\nschema.cast_row(['6', 'N/A', 'Walt'])\n# Cast error\nschema.descriptor['missingValues'] = ['', 'N/A']\nschema.commit()\nschema.cast_row(['6', 'N/A', 'Walt'])\n# [ 6, None, 'Walt' ]\n\nWe could save the schema to a local file. And we could continue the work in any time just loading it from the local file:\nschema.save('schema.json')\nschema = Schema('schema.json')\n\nIt was onle basic introduction to the Schema class. To learn more let's take a look on Schema class API reference.\nSchema(descriptor, strict=False)\nConstructor to instantiate Schema class.\n\ndescriptor (str/dict) - schema descriptor:\nlocal path\nremote url\ndictionary\n\n\nstrict (bool) - flag to alter validation behaviour:\nif false error will not be raised and all error will be collected in schema.errors\nif strict is true any validation error will be raised immediately\n\n\n(exceptions.TableSchemaException) - raises any error occured in the process\n(Schema) - returns schema class instance\n\nschema.valid\n\n(bool) - returns validation status. It always true in strict mode.\n\nschema.errors\n\n(Exception[]) - returns validation errors.

Field\nfrom tableschema import Field\n\n# Init field\nfield = Field({'name': 'name', type': 'number'})\n\n# Cast a value\nfield.cast_value('12345') # -> 12345\n\nData values can be cast to native Python objects with a Field instance. Type instances can be initialized with field descriptors. This allows formats and constraints to be defined.\nCasting a value will check the value is of the expected type, is in the correct format, and complies with any constraints imposed by a schema. E.g. a date value (in ISO 8601 format) can be cast with a DateType instance. Values that can't be cast will raise an InvalidCastError exception.\nCasting a value that doesn't meet the constraints will raise a ConstraintError exception.\nHere is an API reference for the Field class:\nnew Field(descriptor, missingValues=[''])\nConstructor to instantiate Field class.\n\ndescriptor (dict) - schema field descriptor\nmissingValues (str[]) - an array with string representing missing values\n(exceptions.TableSchemaException) - raises any error occured in the process\n(Field) - returns field class instance\n\nfield.name\n\n(str) - returns field name\n\nfield.type\n\n(str) - returns field type\n\nfield.format\n\n(str) - returns field format\n\nfield.required\n\n(bool) - returns true if field is required\n\nfield.constraints\n\n(dict) - returns an object with field constraints\n\nfield.descriptor\n\n(dict) - returns field descriptor\n\nfield.castValue(value, constraints=true)\nCast given value according to the field type and format.\n\nvalue (any) - value to cast against field\nconstraints (boll/str[]) - gets constraints configuration\nit could be set to true to disable constraint checks\nit could be an Array of constraints to check e.g. ['minimum', 'maximum']\n\n\n(exceptions.TableSchemaException) - raises any error occured in the process\n(any) - returns cast value\n\nfield.testValue(value, constraints=true)\nTest if value is compliant to the field.\n\nvalue (any) - value to cast against field\nconstraints (bool/str[]) - constraints configuration\n(bool) - returns if value is compliant to the field\n\n1.3.4. validate\nGiven a schema as JSON file, url to JSON file, or a Python dict, validate returns True for a valid Table Schema, or raises an exception, exceptions.ValidationError. It validates only schema, not data against schema!\nfrom tableschema import validate, exceptions\n\ntry:\n    valid = validate(descriptor)\nexcept exceptions.ValidationError as exception:\n   for error in exception.errors:\n       # handle individual error\n\nvalidate(descriptor)\nValidate a Table Schema descriptor.\n\ndescriptor (str/dict) - schema descriptor (one of):\nlocal path\nremote url\nobject\n\n\n(exceptions.ValidationError) - raises on invalid\n(bool) - returns true on valid\n\n1.3.5. infer\nGiven headers and data, infer will return a Table Schema as a Python dict based on the data values. Given the data file, data_to_infer.csv:\nid,age,name\n1,39,Paul\n2,23,Jimmy\n3,36,Jane\n4,28,Judy\nLet's call infer for this file:\nfrom tableschema import infer\n\ndescriptor = infer('data_to_infer.csv')\n#{'fields': [\n#    {\n#        'format': 'default',\n#        'name': 'id',\n#        'type': 'integer'\n#    },\n#    {\n#        'format': 'default',\n#        'name': 'age',\n#        'type': 'integer'\n#    },\n#    {\n#        'format': 'default',\n#        'name': 'name',\n#        'type': 'string'\n#    }]\n#}\n\nThe number of rows used by infer can be limited with the limit argument.\ninfer(source, headers=1, limit=100, **options)\nInfer source schema.\n\nsource (any) - source as path, url or inline data\nheaders (int/str[]) - headers rows number or headers list\n(exceptions.TableSchemaException) - raises any error occured in the process\n(dict) - returns schema descriptor\n\n1.3.6. Exceptions\nexceptions.TableSchemaException\nBase class for all library exceptions. If there are multiple errors it could be read from an exceptions object:\n\ntry:\n    # lib action\nexcept exceptions.TableSchemaException as exception:\n    if exception.multiple:\n        for error in exception.errors:\n            # handle error\n\nexceptions.LoadError\nAll loading errors.\nexceptions.ValidationError\nAll validation errors.\nexceptions.CastError\nAll value cast errors.\nexceptions.RelationError\nAll integrity errors.\nexceptions.StorageError\nAll storage errors.\n1.3.7. Storage\nThe library includes interface declaration to implement tabular Storage. This interface allow to use different data storage systems like SQL with tableschema.Table class (load/save) as well as on the data package level:\n\nFor instantiation of concrete storage instances tableschema.Storage provides a unified factory method connect (under the hood the plugin system will be used):\n# pip install tableschema_sql\nfrom tableschema import Storage\n\nstorage = Storage.connect('sql', **options)\nstorage.create('bucket', descriptor)\nstorage.write('bucket', rows)\nstorage.read('bucket')\n\nStorage.connect(name, **options)\nCreate tabular storage based on storage name.\n\nname (str) - storage name like sql\noptions (dict) - concrete storage options\n(exceptions.StorageError) - raises on any error\n(Storage) - returns Storage instance\n\n\nAn implementor should follow tableschema.Storage interface to write his own storage backend. Concrete storage backends could include additional functionality specific to conrete storage system. See plugins system below to know how to integrate custom storage plugin into your workflow.\n>Storage(**options)\nCreate tabular storage. Implementations should fully implement this interface to be compatible to Storage API.\n\noptions (dict) - concrete storage options\n(exceptions.StorageError) - raises on any error\n(Storage) - returns Storage instance\n\nstorage.buckets\nReturn list of storage bucket names. A bucket is a special term which has almost the same meaning as the term table. You should consider bucket as a table stored in the storage.\n\n(exceptions.StorageError) - raises on any error\nstr[] - return list of bucket names\n\ncreate(bucket, descriptor, force=False)\nCreate one/multiple buckets.\n\nbucket (str/list) - bucket name or list of bucket names\ndescriptor (dict/dict[]) - schema descriptor or list of descriptors\nforce (bool) - delete and re-create already existent buckets\n(exceptions.StorageError) - raises on any error\n\ndelete(bucket=None, ignore=False)\nDelete one/multiple/all buckets.\n\nbucket (str/list/None) - bucket name or list of bucket names to delete. If None all buckets will be deleted\ndescriptor (dict/dict[]) - schema descriptor or list of descriptors\nignore (bool) - don't raise an error on non-existent bucket deletion from storage\n(exceptions.StorageError) - raises on any error\n\ndescribe(bucket, descriptor=None)\nGet/set bucket's Table Schema descriptor.\n\nbucket (str) - bucket name\ndescriptor (dict/None) - schema descriptor to set\n(exceptions.StorageError) - raises on any error\n(dict) - returns Table Schema descriptor\n\niter(bucket)\nThis method should iter typed values based on the schema of this bucket.\n\nbucket (str) - bucket name\n(exceptions.StorageError) - raises on any error\n(list[]) - yields data rows\n\nread(bucket)\nThis method should read typed values based on the schema of this bucket.\n\nbucket (str) - bucket name\n(exceptions.StorageError) - raises on any error\n(list[]) - returns data rows\n\nwrite(bucket, rows)\nThis method writes data rows into the storage. It should store values of unsupported types as strings internally (like csv does).\n\nbucket (str) - bucket name\nrows (list[]) - data rows to write\n(exceptions.StorageError) - raises on any error\n\n1.3.8. Plugins\nTable Schema has a plugin system.  Any package with the name like tableschema_ could be imported as:\nfrom tableschema.plugins import \n\nIf a plugin is not installed ImportError will be raised with a message describing how to install the plugin.\nOfficial plugins\n\nBigQuery Storage\nElasticsearch Storage\nPandas Storage\nSQL Storage\nSPSS Storage\n\n1.3.9. CLI\n\nIt's a provisional API excluded from SemVer. If you use it as a part of other program please pin concrete tableschema version to your requirements file.\n\nTable Schema features a CLI called tableschema. This CLI exposes the infer and validate functions for command line use.\nExample of validate usage:\n$ tableschema validate path/to-schema.json\nExample of infer usage:\n$ tableschema infer path/to/data.csv\nThe response is a schema as JSON. The optional argument --encoding allows a character encoding to be specified for the data file. The default is utf-8.\n1.4. Contributing\nThe project follows the Open Knowledge International coding standards.\nRecommended way to get started is to create and activate a project virtual environment.\nTo install package and development dependencies into active environment:\n$ make install\nTo run tests with linting and coverage:\n$ make test\n\nFor linting pylama configured in pylama.ini is used. On this stage it's already\ninstalled into your environment and could be used separately with more fine-grained control\nas described in documentation - https://pylama.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.\nFor example to sort results by error type:\n$ pylama --sort \n\nFor testing tox configured in tox.ini is used.\nIt's already installed into your environment and could be used separately with more fine-grained control as described in documentation - https://testrun.org/tox/latest/.\nFor example to check subset of tests against Python 2 environment with increased verbosity.\nAll positional arguments and options after -- will be passed to py.test:\ntox -e py27 -- -v tests/\n\nUnder the hood tox uses pytest configured in pytest.ini, coverage\nand mock packages. This packages are available only in tox envionments.\n1.5. Changelog\nHere described only breaking and the most important changes.

Getting started\n1.2.1. Installation\nThe package use semantic versioning. It means that major versions  could include breaking changes. It's highly recommended to specify tabulator version range if you use setup.py or requirements.txt file e.g. tabulator.\n$ pip install tabulator # OR \"sudo pip install tabulator\"\n\n1.2.2. Examples\nIt's pretty simple to start with tabulator:\nfrom tabulator import Stream\n\nwith Stream('path.csv', headers=1) as stream:\n    stream.headers # [header1, header2, ..]\n    for row in stream:\n        row  # [value1, value2, ..]\n\nThere is an examples directory containing other code listings.\n1.3. Documentation\nThe whole public API of this package is described here and follows semantic versioning rules. Everyting outside of this readme are private API and could be changed without any notification on any new version.\n1.3.1. Stream\nThe Stream class represents a tabular stream. It takes the source argument in a form of source string or object:\n://path/to/file.\nand uses corresponding Loader and Parser to open and start to iterate over the tabular stream. Also user can pass scheme and format explicitly as constructor arguments. There are also alot other options described in sections below.\nLet's create a simple stream object to read csv file:\nfrom tabulator import Stream\n\nstream = Stream('data.csv')\n\nThis action just instantiate a stream instance. There is no actual IO interactions or source validity checks. We need to open the stream object.\nstream.open()\n\nThis call will validate data source, open underlaying stream and read the data sample (if it's not disabled). All possible exceptions will be raised on stream.open call not on constructor call.\nAfter work with the stream is done it could be closed:\nstream.close()\n\nThe Stream class supports Python context manager interface so calls above could be written using with syntax. It's a common and recommended way to use tabulator stream:\nwith Stream('data.csv') as stream:\n  # use stream\n\nNow we could iterate over rows in our tabular data source. It's important to understand that tabulator uses underlaying streams not loading it to memory (just one row at time). So the stream.iter() interface is the most effective way to use the stream:\nfor row in stream.iter():\n  row # [value1, value2, ..]\n\nBut if you need all the data in one call you could use stream.read() function instead of stream.iter() function. But if you just run it after code snippet above the stream.read() call will return an empty list. That another important following of stream nature of tabulator - the Stream instance just iterates over an underlaying stream. The underlaying stream has internal pointer (for example as file-like object has). So after we've iterated over all rows in the first listing the pointer is set to the end of stream.\nstream.read() # []\n\nThe recommended way is to iterate (or read) over stream just once (and save data to memory if needed). But there is a possibility to reset the steram pointer. For some sources it will not be effective (another HTTP request for remote source). But if you work with local file as a source for example it's just a cheap file.seek() call:\nstream.reset()\nstream.read() # [[value1, value2, ..], ..]\nThe Stream class supports saving tabular data stream to the filesystem. Let's reset stream again (dont' forget about the pointer) and save it to the disk:\nstream.reset()\nstream.save('data-copy.csv')\nThe full session will be looking like this:\nfrom tabulator import Stream\n\nwith Stream('data.csv') as stream:\n  for row in stream.iter():\n    row # [value1, value2, ..]\n  stream.reset()\n  stream.read() # [[value1, value2, ..], ..]\n  stream.reset()\n  stream.save('data-copy.csv')\n\nIt's just a pretty basic Stream introduction. Please read the full documentation below and about Stream arguments in more detail in following sections. There are many other goodies like headers extraction, keyed output, post parse processors and many more!\nStream(source, **options)\nCreate stream class instance.\n\nsource (any) - stream source in a form based on scheme argument\nheaders (list/int) - headers list or row number containing headers or row numbers range containing headers. If number is given for plain source headers row and all rows before will be removed and for keyed source no rows will be removed. See headers section.\nscheme (str) - source scheme with file as default. For the most cases scheme will be inferred from source. See a list of supported schemas below. See schemes section.\nformat (str) - source format with None (detect) as default. For the most cases format will be inferred from source.  See a list of supported formats below. See formats section.\nencoding (str) - source encoding with  None (detect) as default.  See encoding section.\ncompression (str) - source compression like zip with  None (detect) as default. See compression section.\nallow_html (bool) - a flag to allow html.  See allow html section.\nsample_size (int) - rows count for table.sample. Set to \"0\" to prevent any parsing activities before actual table.iter call. In this case headers will not be extracted from the source. See sample size section.\nbytes_sample_size (int) - sample size in bytes for operations like encoding detection. See bytes sample size section.\nignore_blank_headers (bool) - a flag to ignore any column having a blank header. See ignore blank headers section.\nforce_strings (bool) - if True all output will be converted to strings.  See force strings section.\nforce_parse (bool) - if True on row parsing error a stream will return an empty row instead of raising an exception. See force parse section.\nskip_rows (int/str[]) - list of rows to skip by row number or row comment. Example: skip_rows=[1, 2, -1, -3, '#', '//'] - rows 1, 2 and rows 1, 3 from the end and all rows started with # and // will be skipped. See skip rows section.\npost_parse (generator[]) - post parse processors (hooks). Signature to follow is processor(extended_rows) -> yield (row_number, headers, row) which should yield one extended row per yield instruction. See post parse section.\ncustom_loaders (dict) - loaders keyed by scheme. See a section below. See custom loaders section.\ncustom_parsers (dict) - custom parsers keyed by format. See a section below. See custom parsers section.\ncustom_writers (dict) - custom writers keyed by format. See a section below. See custom writers section.\n () - loader/parser options. See in the scheme/format section\n(Stream) - returns Stream class instance\n\nstream.closed\n\n(bool) - returnsTrue if underlaying stream is closed\n\nstream.open()\nOpen stream by opening underlaying stream.\nstream.close()\nClose stream by closing underlaying stream.\nstream.reset()\nReset stream pointer to the first row.\nstream.headers\n\n(str[]) - returns data headers\n\nstream.scheme\n\n(str) - returns an actual scheme\n\nstream.format\n\n(str) - returns an actual format\n\nstream.encoding\n\n(str) - returns an actual encoding\n\nstream.sample\n\n(list) - returns data sample\n\nstream.iter(keyed=False, extended=False)\nIter stream rows. See keyed and extended rows section.\n\nkeyed (bool) - if True yield keyed rows\nextended (bool) - if True yield extended rows\n(any[]/any{}) - yields row/keyed row/extended row\n\nstream.read(keyed=False, extended=False, limit=None)\nRead table rows with count limit. See keyed and extended rows section.\n\nkeyed (bool) - return keyed rows\nextended (bool) - return extended rows\nlimit (int) - rows count limit\n(list) - returns rows/keyed rows/extended rows\n\nstream.save(target, format=None,  encoding=None, **options)\nSave stream to filesystem.\n\ntarget (str) - stream target\nformat (str) - saving format. See supported formats\nencoding (str) - saving encoding\noptions (dict) - writer options\n\n1.3.2. Schemes\nThere is a list of all supported schemes.\nfile\nThe default scheme. Source should be a file in local filesystem. You could provide a string or a pathlib.Path instance:\nstream = Stream('data.csv')\nstream = Stream(pathlib.Path('data.csv'))\n\nhttp/https/ftp/ftps\n\nIn Python 2 tabulator can't stream remote data source because of underlaying libraries limitation. The whole data source will be loaded to the memory. In Python 3 there is no such a problem and tabulator is able to stream remote data source as expected.\n\nSource should be a file available via one of this protocols in the web.\nstream = Stream('http://example.com/data.csv')\n\nOptions:\n\nhttp_session - a requests.Session object. Read more in the requests docs.\nhttp_stream - use HTTP streaming when possible. It's enabled by default. Disable if you'd like to preload the whole file into memory first.\n\nstream\nSource should be a file-like python object which supports corresponding protocol.\nstream = Stream(open('data.csv'))\n\ntext\nSource should be a string containing tabular data. In this case format has to be explicitely passed because it's not possible to infer it from source string.\nstream = Stream('text://name,age\\nJohn, 21\\n', format='csv')\n\n1.3.3. Formats\nThere is a list of all supported formats. Formats support read operation could be opened by Stream.open() and formats support write operation could be used in Stream.save().\ncsv\nSource should be parsable by csv parser.\nstream = Stream('data.csv', delimiter=',')\n\nOperations:\n\nread\nwrite\n\nOptions:\n\ndelimiter\ndoublequote\nescapechar\nquotechar\nquoting\nskipinitialspace\nlineterminator\n\nSee options reference in Python documentation.\ndatapackage\n\nThis format is not included to package by default. To use it please install tabulator with an datapackage extras: $ pip install tabulator[datapackage]\n\nSource should be a valid Tabular Data Package see (https://frictionlessdata.io).\nstream = Stream('datapackage.json', resource=1)\n\nOperations:\n\nread\n\nOptions:\n\nresource - resource index (starting from 0) or resource name\n\ngsheet\nSource should be a link to publicly available Google Spreadsheet.\nstream = Stream('https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/?usp=sharing')\nstream = Stream('https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/edit#gid=')\n\ninline\nSource should be a list of lists or a list of dicts.\nstream = Stream([['name', 'age'], ['John', 21], ['Alex', 33]])\nstream = Stream([{'name': 'John', 'age': 21}, {'name': 'Alex', 'age': 33}])\n\nOperations:\n\nread\n\njson\nSource should be a valid JSON document containing array of arrays or array of objects (see inline format example).\nstream = Stream('data.json', property='key1.key2')\n\nOperations:\n\nread\n\nOptions:\n\nproperty - path to tabular data property separated by dots. For example having data structure like {\"response\": {\"data\": [...]}} you should set property to response.data.\n\nndjson\nSource should be parsable by ndjson parser.\nstream = Stream('data.ndjson')\n\nOperations:\n\nread\n\nods\n\nThis format is not included to package by default. To use it please install tabulator with an ods extras: $ pip install tabulator[ods]\n\nSource should be a valid Open Office document.\nstream = Stream('data.ods', sheet=1)\n\nOperations:\n\nread\n\nOptions:\n\nsheet - sheet number starting from 1 OR sheet name\n\nsql\nSource should be a valid database URL supported by sqlalchemy.\nstream = Stream('postgresql://name:pass@host:5432/database', table='data')\n\nOperations:\n\nread\n\nOptions:\n\ntable - database table name to read data (REQUIRED)\norder_by - SQL expression to order rows e.g. name desc\n\ntsv\nSource should be parsable by tsv parser.\nstream = Stream('data.tsv')\n\nOperations:\n\nread\n\nxls/xlsx\n\nFor xls format tabulator can't stream data source because of underlaying libraries limitation. The whole data source will be loaded to the memory. For xlsx format there is no such a problem and tabulator is able to stream data source as expected.\n\nSource should be a valid Excel document.\nstream = Stream('data.xls', sheet=1)\n\nOperations:\n\nread\n\nOptions:\n\nsheet - sheet number starting from 1 OR sheet name\nfill_merged_cells - if True it will unmerge and fill all merged cells by a visible value. With this option enabled the parser can't stream data and load the whole document into memory.\n\n1.3.4. Headers\nBy default Stream considers all data source rows as values:\nwith Stream([['name', 'age'], ['Alex', 21]]):\n  stream.headers # None\n  stream.read() # [['name', 'age'], ['Alex', 21]]\n\nTo alter this behaviour headers argument is supported by Stream constructor. This argument could be an integer - row number starting from 1 containing headers:\n# Integer\nwith Stream([['name', 'age'], ['Alex', 21]], headers=1):\n  stream.headers # ['name', 'age']\n  stream.read() # [['Alex', 21]]\n\nOr it could be a list of strings - user-defined headers:\nwith Stream([['Alex', 21]], headers=['name', 'age']):\n  stream.headers # ['name', 'age']\n  stream.read() # [['Alex', 21]]\n\nIt's possible to use multiline headers:\nwith Stream('data.xlsx', headers=[1,3], fill_merged_cells=True):\n  stream.headers # ['header from row 1-3']\n  stream.read() # [['value1', 'value2', 'value3']]\n\nIf headers is a row number/range and data source is not keyed all rows before headers and headers will be removed from data stream (see first example).\n1.3.5. Encoding\nStream constructor accepts encoding argument to ensure needed encoding will be used. As a value argument supported by python encoding name (e.g. 'latin1', 'utf-8', ..) could be used:\nwith Stream(source, encoding='latin1') as stream:\n  stream.read()\n\nBy default an encoding will be detected automatically. If you experience a UnicodeDecodeError parsing your file, try setting this argument to 'utf-8'.\n1.3.6. Compression\nStream constructor accepts compression argument to ensure that needed compression will be used. By default compression will be inferred from file name:\nwith Stream('http://example.com/data.csv.zip') as stream:\n  stream.read()\n\nProvide user defined compression e.g. gz:\nwith Stream('data.csv.ext', compression='zip') as stream:\n  stream.read()\n\nAt the moment tabulator supports:\n\nzip compression (Python3)\ngz compression (Python3)\n\n1.3.7. Allow html\nBy default Stream will raise exceptions.FormatError on stream.open() call if html contents is detected. It's not a tabular format and for example providing link to csv file inside html (e.g. GitHub page) is a common mistake.\nBut sometimes this default behaviour is not what is needed. For example you write custom parser which should support html contents. In this case allow_html option for Stream could be used:\nwith Stream(sorce_with_html, allow_html=True) as stream:\n  stream.read() # no exception on open\n\n1.3.8. Sample size\nBy default Stream will read some data on stream.open() call in advance. This data is provided as stream.sample. The size of this sample could be set in rows using sample_size argument of stream constructor:\nwith Stream(two_rows_source, sample_size=1) as stream:\n  stream.sample # only first row\n  stream.read() # first and second rows\n\nData sample could be really useful if you want to implement some initial data checks without moving stream pointer as stream.iter/read do. But if you don't want any interactions with an actual source before first stream.iter/read call just disable data smapling with sample_size=0.\n1.3.9. Bytes sample size\nOn initial reading stage tabulator should detect contents encoding. The argument bytes_sample_size customizes how many bytes will be read to detect encoding:\nsource = 'data/special/latin1.csv'\nwith Stream(source) as stream:\n    stream.encoding # 'iso8859-2'\nwith Stream(source, sample_size=0, bytes_sample_size=10) as stream:\n    stream.encoding # 'utf-8'\n\nIn this example our data file doesn't include iso8859-2 characters in first 10 bytes. So we could see the difference in encoding detection. Note sample_size usage here - these two parameters are independent. Here we use sample_size=0 to prevent rows sample creation (will fail with bad encoding).\n1.3.10. Ignore blank headers\nSome data tables could have blank headers. For example it could be an empty strings in csv or None values in inline data. By default tabulator processes it as an ordinary header:\nsource = 'text://header1,,header3\\nvalue1,value2,value3'\nwith Stream(source, format='csv', headers=1) as stream:\n    stream.headers # ['header1', '', 'header3']\n    stream.read(keyed=True) # {'header1': 'value1', '': 'value2', 'header3': 'value3'}\nBut sometimes it's not a desired behavior. You could ignore columns with a blank header completely using an ignore_blank_headers flag:\nsource = 'text://header1,,header3\\nvalue1,value2,value3'\nwith Stream(source, format='csv', headers=1, ignore_blank_headers=True) as stream:\n    stream.headers # ['header1', 'header3']\n    stream.read(keyed=True) # {'header1': 'value1', 'header3': 'value3'}\n1.3.11. Force strings\nBecause tabulator support not only sources with string data representation as csv but also sources supporting different data types as json or inline there is a Stream option force_strings to stringify all data values on reading.\nHere how stream works without forcing strings:\nwith Stream([['string', 1, datetime.time(17, 00)]]) as stream:\n  stream.read() # [['string', 1, datetime.time(17, 00)]]\n\nThe same data source using force_strings option:\nwith Stream([['string', 1]], force_strings=True) as stream:\n  stream.read() # [['string', '1', '17:00:00']]\n\nFor all temporal values stream will use ISO format. But if your data source doesn't support temporal values (for instance json format) Stream just returns it as it is without converting to ISO format.\n1.3.12. Force parse\nSome data source could be partially mailformed for a parser. For example inline source could have good rows (lists or dicts) and bad rows (for example strings). By default stream.iter/read will raise exceptions.SourceError on the first bad row:\nwith Stream([[1], 'bad', [3]]) as stream:\n  stream.read() # raise exceptions.SourceError\n\nWith force_parse option for Stream constructor this default behaviour could be changed. If it's set to True non-parsable rows will be returned as empty rows:\nwith Stream([[1], 'bad', [3]]) as stream:\n  stream.read() # [[1], [], [3]]\n\n1.3.13. Skip rows\nIt's a very common situation when your tabular data contains some rows you want to skip. It could be blank rows or commented rows. Stream constructors accepts skip_rows argument to make it possible. Value of this argument should be a list of integers and strings where:\n\ninteger is a row number (1 is the first row, -1 is the last)\nstring is a first row chars indicating that row is a comment\n\nLet's skip first, second, last and commented by '#' symbol rows:\nsource = [['John', 1], ['Alex', 2], ['#Sam', 3], ['Mike', 4], ['John', 5]]\nwith Stream(source, skip_rows=[1, 2, -1, '#']) as stream:\n  stream.read() # [['Mike', 4]]\n\n1.3.14. Post parse\nSkipping rows is a very basic ETL (extrac-transform-load) feature. For more advanced data transormations there are post parse processors.\ndef skip_odd_rows(extended_rows):\n    for row_number, headers, row in extended_rows:\n        if not row_number % 2:\n            yield (row_number, headers, row)\n\ndef multiply_on_two(extended_rows):\n    for row_number, headers, row in extended_rows:\n        yield (row_number, headers, list(map(lambda value: value * 2, row)))\n\n\nwith Stream([[1], [2], [3], [4]], post_parse=[skip_odd_rows, multiply_on_two]) as stream:\n  stream.read() # [[4], [8]]\n\nPost parse processor gets extended rows ([row_number, headers, row]) iterator and must yields updated extended rows back. This interface is very powerful because every processors have full control on iteration process could skip rows, catch exceptions etc.\nProcessors will be applied to source from left to right. For example in listing above multiply_on_two processor gets rows from skip_odd_rows processor.\n1.3.15. Keyed and extended rows\nStream methods stream.iter/read() accept keyed and extended flags to vary data structure of output data row.\nBy default a stream returns every row as a list:\nwith Stream([['name', 'age'], ['Alex', 21]]) as stream:\n  stream.read() # [['Alex', 21]]\n\nWith keyed=True a stream returns every row as a dict:\nwith Stream([['name', 'age'], ['Alex', 21]]) as stream:\n  stream.read(keyed=True) # [{'name': 'Alex', 'age': 21}]\n\nAnd with extended=True a stream returns every row as a tuple contining row number starting from 1, headers as a list and row as a list:\nwith Stream([['name', 'age'], ['Alex', 21]]) as stream:\n  stream.read(extended=True) # (1, ['name', 'age'], ['Alex', 21])\n\n1.3.16. Custom loaders\nTo create a custom loader Loader interface should be implemented and passed to Stream constructor as custom_loaders={'scheme': CustomLoader} argument.\nFor example let's implement a custom loader:\nfrom tabulator import Loader\n\nclass CustomLoader(Loader):\n  options = []\n  def __init__(self, bytes_sample_size, **options):\n        pass\n  def load(self, source, mode='t', encoding=None):\n    # load logic\n\nwith Stream(source, custom_loaders={'custom': CustomLoader}) as stream:\n  stream.read()\n\nThere are more examples in internal tabulator.loaders module.\nLoader.options\nList of supported custom options.\nLoader(bytes_sample_size, **options)\n\nbytes_sample_size (int) - sample size in bytes\noptions (dict) - loader options\n(Loader) - returns Loader class instance\n\nloader.load(source, mode='t', encoding=None)\n\nsource (str) - table source\nmode (str) - text stream mode: 't' or 'b'\nencoding (str) - encoding of source\n(file-like) - returns file-like object of bytes or chars based on mode argument\n\n1.3.17. Custom parsers\nTo create a custom parser Parser interface should be implemented and passed to Stream constructor as custom_parsers={'format': CustomParser} argument.\nFor example let's implement a custom parser:\nfrom tabulator import Parser\n\nclass CustomParser(Parser):\n  options = []\n  def __init__(self, loader, force_parse, **options):\n    self.__loader = loader\n  @property\n  def closed(self):\n    return False\n  def open(self, source, encoding=None):\n    # open logic\n  def close(self):\n    # close logic\n  def reset(self):\n    raise NotImplemenedError()\n  @property\n  def extended_rows():\n    # extended rows logic\n\nwith Stream(source, custom_parsers={'custom': CustomParser}) as stream:\n  stream.read()\n\nThere are more examples in internal tabulator.parsers module.\nParser.options\nList of supported custom options.\nParser(loader, force_parse, **options)\nCreate parser class instance.\n\nloader (Loader) - loader instance\nforce_parse (bool) - if True parser must yield (row_number, None, []) if there is an row in parsing error instead of stopping the iteration by raising an exception\noptions (dict) - parser options\n(Parser) - returns Parser class instance\n\nparser.closed\n\n(bool) - returns True if parser is closed\n\nparser.open(source, encoding=None)\nOpen underlaying stream. Parser gets byte or text stream from loader\nto start emit items from this stream.\n\nsource (str) - table source\nencoding (str) - encoding of source\n\nparser.close()\nClose underlaying stream.\nparser.reset()\nReset items and underlaying stream. After reset call iterations over items will start from scratch.\nparser.encoding\n\n(str) - returns an actual encoding\n\nparser.extended_rows\n\n(iterator) - returns extended rows iterator\n\n1.3.18. Custom writers\nTo create a custom writer Writer interface should be implemented and passed to Stream constructor as custom_writers={'format': CustomWriter} argument.\nFor example let's implement a custom writer:\nfrom tabulator import Writer\n\nclass CustomWriter(Writer):\n  options = []\n  def __init__(self, **options):\n        pass\n  def save(self, source, target, headers=None, encoding=None):\n    # save logic\n\nwith Stream(source, custom_writers={'custom': CustomWriter}) as stream:\n  stream.save(target)\n\nThere are more examples in internal tabulator.writers module.\nWriter.options\nList of supported custom options.\nWriter(**options)\nCreate writer class instance.\n\noptions (dict) - writer options\n(Writer) - returns Writer class instance\n\nwriter.save(source, target, headers=None, encoding=None)\nSave source data to target.\n\nsource (str) - data source\nsource (str) - save target\nheaders (str[]) - optional headers\nencoding (str) - encoding of source\n\n1.3.19. Validate\nFor cases you don't need open the source but want to know is it supported by tabulator or not you could use validate function. It also let you know what exactly is not supported raising correspondig exception class.\nfrom tabulator import validate, exceptions\n\ntry:\n  tabular = validate('data.csv')\nexcept exceptions.TabulatorException:\n  tabular = False\n\nvalidate(source, scheme=None, format=None)\nValidate if this source has supported scheme and format.\n\nsource (any) - data source\nscheme (str) - data scheme\nformat (str) - data format\n(exceptions.SchemeError) - raises if scheme is not supported\n(exceptions.FormatError) - raises if format is not supported\n(bool) - returns True if scheme/format is supported\n\n1.3.20. Exceptions\nexceptions.TabulatorException\nBase class for all tabulator exceptions.\nexceptions.IOError\nAll underlaying input-output errors.\nexceptions.HTTPError\nAll underlaying HTTP errors.\nexceptions.SourceError\nThis class of exceptions covers all source errors like bad data structure for JSON.\nexceptions.SchemeError\nFor example this exceptions will be used if you provide not supported source scheme like bad://source.csv.\nexceptions.FormatError\nFor example this exceptions will be used if you provide not supported source format like http://source.bad.\nexceptions.EncodingError\nAll errors related to encoding problems.\n1.3.21. CLI\n\nIt's a provisional API. If you use it as a part of other program please pin concrete goodtables version to your requirements file.\n\nThe library ships with a simple CLI to read tabular data:\n$ tabulator data/table.csv\nid, name\n1, english\n2, 中国人\n\n$ tabulator\nUsage: cli.py [OPTIONS] SOURCE\n\nOptions:\n  --headers INTEGER\n  --scheme TEXT\n  --format TEXT\n  --encoding TEXT\n  --limit INTEGER\n  --help             Show this message and exit.\n\n1.4. Contributing\nThe project follows the Open Knowledge International coding standards.\nRecommended way to get started is to create and activate a project virtual environment. To install package and development dependencies into active environment:\n$ make install\nTo run tests with linting and coverage:\n$ make test\n\nFor linting pylama configured in pylama.ini is used. On this stage it's already installed into your environment and could be used separately with more fine-grained control as described in documentation - https://pylama.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.\nFor example to sort results by error type:\n$ pylama --sort \n\nFor testing tox configured in tox.ini is used. It's already installed into your environment and could be used separately with more fine-grained control as described in documentation - https://testrun.org/tox/latest/.\nFor example to check subset of tests against Python 2 environment with increased verbosity. All positional arguments and options after -- will be passed to py.test:\ntox -e py27 -- -v tests/\n\nUnder the hood tox uses pytest configured in pytest.ini, coverage and mock packages. This packages are available only in tox envionments.\n1.5. Changelog\nHere described only breaking and the most important changes.

Documentation\n1.3.1. Package\nA class for working with data packages. It provides various capabilities like loading local or remote data package, inferring a data package descriptor, saving a data package descriptor and many more.\nConsider we have some local csv files in a data directory. Let's create a data package based on this data using a Package class:\n\ndata/cities.csv\n\ncity,location\nlondon,\"51.50,-0.11\"\nparis,\"48.85,2.30\"\nrome,\"41.89,12.51\"\n\n\ndata/population.csv\n\ncity,year,population\nlondon,2017,8780000\nparis,2017,2240000\nrome,2017,2860000\n\nFirst we create a blank data package::\nconst dataPackage = await Package.load()\n\nNow we're ready to infer a data package descriptor based on data files we have. Because we have two csv files we use glob pattern **/*.csv:\nawait dataPackage.infer('**/*.csv')\ndataPackage.descriptor\n//{ profile: 'tabular-data-package',\n//  resources:\n//   [ { path: 'data/cities.csv',\n//       profile: 'tabular-data-resource',\n//       encoding: 'utf-8',\n//       name: 'cities',\n//       format: 'csv',\n//       mediatype: 'text/csv',\n//       schema: [Object] },\n//     { path: 'data/population.csv',\n//       profile: 'tabular-data-resource',\n//       encoding: 'utf-8',\n//       name: 'population',\n//       format: 'csv',\n//       mediatype: 'text/csv',\n//       schema: [Object] } ] }\n\nAn infer method has found all our files and inspected it to extract useful metadata like profile, encoding, format, Table Schema etc. Let's tweak it a little bit:\ndataPackage.descriptor.resources[1].schema.fields[1].type = 'year'\ndataPackage.commit()\ndataPackage.valid // true\n\nBecause our resources are tabular we could read it as a tabular data:\nawait dataPackage.getResource('population').read({keyed: true})\n\n//[ { city: 'london', year: 2017, population: 8780000 },\n//  { city: 'paris', year: 2017, population: 2240000 },\n//  { city: 'rome', year: 2017, population: 2860000 } ]\n\nLet's save our descriptor on the disk. After it we could update our datapackage.json as we want, make some changes etc:\nawait dataPackage.save('datapackage.json')\n\nTo continue the work with the data package we just load it again but this time using local datapackage.json:\nconst dataPackage = await Package.load('datapackage.json')\n// Continue the work\n\nIt was onle basic introduction to the Package class. To learn more let's take a look on Package class API reference.\nasync Package.load(descriptor, {basePath, strict=false})\nFactory method to instantiate Package class. This method is async and it should be used with await keyword or as a Promise.\n\ndescriptor (String/Object) - data package descriptor as local path, url or object. If ththe path has a zip file extension it will be unzipped to the temp directory first.\nbasePath (String) - base path for all relative paths\nstrict (Boolean) - strict flag to alter validation behavior. Setting it to true leads to throwing errors on any operation with invalid descriptor\n(errors.DataPackageError) - raises error if something goes wrong\n(Package) - returns data package class instance\n\npackage.valid\n\n(Boolean) - returns validation status. It always true in strict mode.\n\npackage.errors\n\n(Error[]) - returns validation errors. It always empty in strict mode.\n\npackage.profile\n\n(Profile) - returns an instance of Profile class (see below).\n\npackage.descriptor\n\n(Object) - returns data package descriptor\n\npackage.resources\n\n(Resource[]) - returns an array of Resource instances (see below).\n\npackage.resourceNames\n\n(String[]) - returns an array of resource names.\n\npackage.getResource(name)\nGet data package resource by name.\n\nname (String) - data resource name\n(Resource/null) - returns Resource instances or null if not found\n\npackage.addResource(descriptor)\nAdd new resource to data package. The data package descriptor will be validated  with newly added resource descriptor.\n\ndescriptor (Object) - data resource descriptor\n(errors.DataPackageError) - raises error if something goes wrong\n(Resource/null) - returns added Resource instance or null if not added\n\npackage.removeResource(name)\nRemove data package resource by name. The data package descriptor will be validated after resource descriptor removal.\n\nname (String) - data resource name\n(errors.DataPackageError) - raises error if something goes wrong\n(Resource/null) - returns removed Resource instances or null if not found\n\nasync package.infer(pattern=false)\nInfer a data package metadata. If pattern is not provided only existent resources will be inferred (added metadata like encoding, profile etc). If pattern is provided new resoures with file names mathing the pattern will be added and inferred. It commits changes to data package instance.\n\npattern (String) - glob pattern for new resources\n(Object) - returns data package descriptor\n\npackage.commit({strict})\nUpdate data package instance if there are in-place changes in the descriptor.\n\nstrict (Boolean) - alter strict mode for further work\n(errors.DataPackageError) - raises error if something goes wrong\n(Boolean) - returns true on success and false if not modified\n\nconst dataPackage = await Package.load({\n    name: 'package',\n    resources: [{name: 'resource', data: ['data']}]\n})\n\ndataPackage.name // package\ndataPackage.descriptor.name = 'renamed-package'\ndataPackage.name // package\ndataPackage.commit()\ndataPackage.name // renamed-package\n\nasync package.save(target)\nSave data package to target destination. If target path has a  zip file extension the package will be zipped and saved entirely. If it has a json file extension only the descriptor will be saved.\n\ntarget (String) - path where to save a data package\n(errors.DataPackageError) - raises error if something goes wrong\n(Boolean) - returns true on success\n\n1.3.2. Resource\nA class for working with data resources. You can read or iterate tabular resources using the iter/read methods and all resource as bytes using rowIter/rowRead methods.\nConsider we have some local csv file. It could be inline data or remote link - all supported by Resource class (except local files for in-brower usage of course). But say it's data.csv for now:\ncity,location\nlondon,\"51.50,-0.11\"\nparis,\"48.85,2.30\"\nrome,N/A\n\nLet's create and read a resource. We use static Resource.load method instantiate a resource. Because resource is tabular we could use resource.read method with a keyed option to get an array of keyed rows:\nconst resource = await Resource.load({path: 'data.csv'})\nresource.tabular // true\nresource.headers // ['city', 'location']\nawait resource.read({keyed: true})\n// [\n//   {city: 'london', location: '51.50,-0.11'},\n//   {city: 'paris', location: '48.85,2.30'},\n//   {city: 'rome', location: 'N/A'},\n// ]\n\nAs we could see our locations are just a strings. But it should be geopoints. Also Rome's location is not available but it's also just a N/A string instead of JavaScript null. First we have to infer resource metadata:\nawait resource.infer()\nresource.descriptor\n//{ path: 'data.csv',\n//  profile: 'tabular-data-resource',\n//  encoding: 'utf-8',\n//  name: 'data',\n//  format: 'csv',\n//  mediatype: 'text/csv',\n// schema: { fields: [ [Object], [Object] ], missingValues: [ '' ] } }\nawait resource.read({keyed: true})\n// Fails with a data validation error\n\nLet's fix not available location. There is a missingValues property in Table Schema specification. As a first try we set missingValues to N/A in resource.descriptor.schema. Resource descriptor could be changed in-place but all changes should be commited by resource.commit():\nresource.descriptor.schema.missingValues = 'N/A'\nresource.commit()\nresource.valid // false\nresource.errors\n// Error: Descriptor validation error:\n//   Invalid type: string (expected array)\n//    at \"/missingValues\" in descriptor and\n//    at \"/properties/missingValues/type\" in profile\n\nAs a good citiziens we've decided to check out recource descriptor validity. And it's not valid! We should use an array for missingValues property. Also don't forget to have an empty string as a missing value:\nresource.descriptor.schema['missingValues'] = ['', 'N/A']\nresource.commit()\nresource.valid // true\n\nAll good. It looks like we're ready to read our data again:\nawait resource.read({keyed: true})\n// [\n//   {city: 'london', location: [51.50,-0.11]},\n//   {city: 'paris', location: [48.85,2.30]},\n//   {city: 'rome', location: null},\n// ]\n\nNow we see that:\n\nlocations are arrays with numeric lattide and longitude\nRome's location is a native JavaScript null\n\nAnd because there are no errors on data reading we could be sure that our data is valid againt our schema. Let's save our resource descriptor:\nawait resource.save('dataresource.json')\n\nLet's check newly-crated dataresource.json. It contains path to our data file, inferred metadata and our missingValues tweak:\n{\n    \"path\": \"data.csv\",\n    \"profile\": \"tabular-data-resource\",\n    \"encoding\": \"utf-8\",\n    \"name\": \"data\",\n    \"format\": \"csv\",\n    \"mediatype\": \"text/csv\",\n    \"schema\": {\n        \"fields\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"city\",\n                \"type\": \"string\",\n                \"format\": \"default\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"name\": \"location\",\n                \"type\": \"geopoint\",\n                \"format\": \"default\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"missingValues\": [\n            \"\",\n            \"N/A\"\n        ]\n    }\n}\n\nIf we decide to improve it even more we could update the dataresource.json file and then open it again. But this time let's read our resoure as a byte stream:\nconst resource = await Resource.load('dataresource.json')\nconst stream = await resource.rawIter({stream: true})\nstream.on('data', (data) => {\n  // handle data chunk as a Buffer\n})\n\nIt was onle basic introduction to the Resource class.

Infer\nA standalone function to infer a data package descriptor.\nconst descriptor = await infer('**/*.csv')\n//{ profile: 'tabular-data-resource',\n//  resources:\n//   [ { path: 'data/cities.csv',\n//       profile: 'tabular-data-resource',\n//       encoding: 'utf-8',\n//       name: 'cities',\n//       format: 'csv',\n//       mediatype: 'text/csv',\n//       schema: [Object] },\n//     { path: 'data/population.csv',\n//       profile: 'tabular-data-resource',\n//       encoding: 'utf-8',\n//       name: 'population',\n//       format: 'csv',\n//       mediatype: 'text/csv',\n//       schema: [Object] } ] }\n\nasync infer(pattern, {basePath})\nThis function is async so it has to be used with await keyword or as a Promise.\n\npattern (String) - glob file pattern\n(Object) - returns data package descriptor\n\n1.3.6. Foreign Keys\nThe library supports foreign keys described in the Table Schema specification. It means if your data package descriptor use resources[].schema.foreignKeys property for some resources a data integrity will be checked on reading operations.\nConsider we have a data package:\nconst DESCRIPTOR = {\n  'resources': [\n    {\n      'name': 'teams',\n      'data': [\n        ['id', 'name', 'city'],\n        ['1', 'Arsenal', 'London'],\n        ['2', 'Real', 'Madrid'],\n        ['3', 'Bayern', 'Munich'],\n      ],\n      'schema': {\n        'fields': [\n          {'name': 'id', 'type': 'integer'},\n          {'name': 'name', 'type': 'string'},\n          {'name': 'city', 'type': 'string'},\n        ],\n        'foreignKeys': [\n          {\n            'fields': 'city',\n            'reference': {'resource': 'cities', 'fields': 'name'},\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    }, {\n      'name': 'cities',\n      'data': [\n        ['name', 'country'],\n        ['London', 'England'],\n        ['Madrid', 'Spain'],\n      ],\n    },\n  ],\n}\n\nLet's check relations for a teams resource:\nconst {Package} = require('datapackage')\n\nconst package = await Package.load(DESCRIPTOR)\nteams = package.getResource('teams')\nawait teams.checkRelations()\n// tableschema.exceptions.RelationError: Foreign key \"['city']\" violation in row \"4\"\n\nAs we could see there is a foreign key violation. That's because our lookup table cities doesn't have a city of Munich but we have a team from there. We need to fix it in cities resource:\npackage.descriptor['resources'][1]['data'].push(['Munich', 'Germany'])\npackage.commit()\nteams = package.getResource('teams')\nawait teams.checkRelations()\n// True\n\nFixed! But not only a check operation is available. We could use relations argument for resource.iter/read methods to dereference a resource relations:\nawait teams.read({keyed: true, relations: true})\n//[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Arsenal', 'city': {'name': 'London', 'country': 'England}},\n// {'id': 2, 'name': 'Real', 'city': {'name': 'Madrid', 'country': 'Spain}},\n// {'id': 3, 'name': 'Bayern', 'city': {'name': 'Munich', 'country': 'Germany}}]\n\nInstead of plain city name we've got a dictionary containing a city data. These resource.iter/read methods will fail with the same as resource.check_relations error if there is an integrity issue. But only if relations: true flag is passed.\n1.3.7. Errors\nerrors.DataPackageError\nBase class for the all library errors. If there are more than one error you could get an additional information from the error object:\ntry {\n  // some lib action\n} catch (error) {\n  console.log(error) // you have N cast errors (see error.errors)\n  if (error.multiple) {\n    for (const error of error.errors) {\n        console.log(error) // cast error M is ...\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n1.4.

Getting started\n1.2.1. Installation\nThe package use semantic versioning. It means that major versions  could include breaking changes. It's highly recommended to specify tableschema version range in your package.json file e.g. tabulator: ^1.0 which  will be added by default by npm install --save.\nNPM\n$ npm install jsontableschema # v0.2\n$ npm install tableschema@latest # v1.0-alpha\n\nCDN\n\n\n1.2.2. Examples\nCode examples in this readme requires Node v8.3+ or proper modern browser . Also you have to wrap code into async function if there is await keyword used. You could see even more example in examples directory.\nconst {Table} = require('tableschema')\n\nconst table = await Table.load('data.csv')\nawait table.infer() // infer a schema\nawait table.read({keyed: true}) // read the data\nawait table.schema.save() // save the schema\nawait table.save() // save the data\n\n1.3. Documentation\n1.3.1. Table\nA table is a core concept in a tabular data world. It represents a data with a metadata (Table Schema). Let's see how we could use it in practice.\nConsider we have some local csv file. It could be inline data or remote link - all supported by Table class (except local files for in-brower usage of course). But say it's data.csv for now:\ncity,location\nlondon,\"51.50,-0.11\"\nparis,\"48.85,2.30\"\nrome,N/A\n\nLet's create and read a table. We use static Table.load method and table.read method with a keyed option to get array of keyed rows:\nconst table = await Table.load('data.csv')\ntable.headers // ['city', 'location']\nawait table.read({keyed: true})\n// [\n//   {city: 'london', location: '51.50,-0.11'},\n//   {city: 'paris', location: '48.85,2.30'},\n//   {city: 'rome', location: 'N/A'},\n// ]\n\nAs we could see our locations are just a strings. But it should be geopoints. Also Rome's location is not available but it's also just a N/A string instead of JavaScript null. First we have to infer Table Schema:\nawait table.infer()\ntable.schema.descriptor\n// { fields:\n//   [ { name: 'city', type: 'string', format: 'default' },\n//     { name: 'location', type: 'geopoint', format: 'default' } ],\n//  missingValues: [ '' ] }\nawait table.read({keyed: true})\n// Fails with a data validation error\n\nLet's fix not available location. There is a missingValues property in Table Schema specification. As a first try we set missingValues to N/A in table.schema.descriptor. Schema descriptor could be changed in-place but all changes sould be commited by table.schema.commit():\ntable.schema.descriptor['missingValues'] = 'N/A'\ntable.schema.commit()\ntable.schema.valid // false\ntable.schema.errors\n// Error: Descriptor validation error:\n//   Invalid type: string (expected array)\n//    at \"/missingValues\" in descriptor and\n//    at \"/properties/missingValues/type\" in profile\n\nAs a good citiziens we've decided to check out schema descriptor validity. And it's not valid! We sould use an array for missingValues property. Also don't forget to have an empty string as a missing value:\ntable.schema.descriptor['missingValues'] = ['', 'N/A']\ntable.schema.commit()\ntable.schema.valid // true\n\nAll good. It looks like we're ready to read our data again:\nawait table.read({keyed: true})\n// [\n//   {city: 'london', location: [51.50,-0.11]},\n//   {city: 'paris', location: [48.85,2.30]},\n//   {city: 'rome', location: null},\n// ]\n\nNow we see that:\n\nlocations are arrays with numeric lattide and longitude\nRome's location is a native JavaScript null\n\nAnd because there are no errors on data reading we could be sure that our data is valid againt our schema. Let's save it:\nawait table.schema.save('schema.json')\nawait table.save('data.csv')\n\nOur data.csv looks the same because it has been stringified back to csv format. But now we have schema.json:\n{\n    \"fields\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"city\",\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"format\": \"default\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"location\",\n            \"type\": \"geopoint\",\n            \"format\": \"default\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"missingValues\": [\n        \"\",\n        \"N/A\"\n    ]\n}\n\nIf we decide to improve it even more we could update the schema file and then open it again. But now providing a schema path and iterating thru the data using Node Streams:\nconst table = await Table.load('data.csv', {schema: 'schema.json'})\nconst stream = await table.iter({stream: true})\nstream.on('data', (row) => {\n  // handle row ['london', [51.50,-0.11]] etc\n  // keyed/extended/cast supported in a stream mode too\n})\n\nIt was onle basic introduction to the Table class. To learn more let's take a look on Table class API reference.\nasync Table.load(source, {schema, strict=false, headers=1, ...parserOptions})\nFactory method to instantiate Table class.

Schema\nA model of a schema with helpful methods for working with the schema and supported data. Schema instances can be initialized with a schema source as a url to a JSON file or a JSON object. The schema is initially validated (see validate below). By default validation errors will be stored in schema.errors but in a strict mode it will be instantly raised.\nLet's create a blank schema. It's not valid because descriptor.fields property is required by the Table Schema specification:\nconst schema = await Schema.load({})\nschema.valid // false\nschema.errors\n// Error: Descriptor validation error:\n//         Missing required property: fields\n//         at \"\" in descriptor and\n//         at \"/required/0\" in profile\n\nTo do not create a schema descriptor by hands we will use a schema.infer method to infer the descriptor from given data:\nschema.infer([\n  ['id', 'age', 'name'],\n  ['1','39','Paul'],\n  ['2','23','Jimmy'],\n  ['3','36','Jane'],\n  ['4','28','Judy'],\n])\nschema.valid // true\nschema.descriptor\n//{ fields:\n//   [ { name: 'id', type: 'integer', format: 'default' },\n//     { name: 'age', type: 'integer', format: 'default' },\n//     { name: 'name', type: 'string', format: 'default' } ],\n//  missingValues: [ '' ] }\n\nNow we have an inferred schema and it's valid. We could cast data row against our schema. We provide a string input by an output will be cast correspondingly:\nschema.castRow(['5', '66', 'Sam'])\n// [ 5, 66, 'Sam' ]\n\nBut if we try provide some missing value to age field cast will fail because for now only one possible missing value is an empty string. Let's update our schema:\nschema.castRow(['6', 'N/A', 'Walt'])\n// Cast error\nschema.descriptor.missingValues = ['', 'N/A']\nschema.commit()\nschema.castRow(['6', 'N/A', 'Walt'])\n// [ 6, null, 'Walt' ]\n\nWe could save the schema to a local file. And we could continue the work in any time just loading it from the local file:\nawait schema.save('schema.json')\nconst schema = await Schema.load('schema.json')\n\nIt was onle basic introduction to the Schema class. To learn more let's take a look on Schema class API reference.\nasync Schema.load(descriptor, {strict=false})\nFactory method to instantiate Schema class. This method is async and it should be used with await keyword or as a Promise.\n\ndescriptor (String/Object) - schema descriptor:\nlocal path\nremote url\nobject\n\n\nstrict (Boolean) - flag to alter validation behaviour:\nif false error will not be raised and all error will be collected in schema.errors\nif strict is true any validation error will be raised immediately\n\n\n(errors.TableSchemaError) - raises any error occured in the process\n(Schema) - returns schema class instance\n\nschema.valid\n\n(Boolean) - returns validation status. It always true in strict mode.\n\nschema.errors\n\n(Error[]) - returns validation errors.

The schema descriptor will be validated with newly added field descriptor.\n\ndescriptor (Object) - field descriptor\n(errors.TableSchemaError) - raises any error occured in the process\n(Field/null) - returns added Field instance or null if not added\n\nschema.removeField(name)\nRemove field resource by name. The schema descriptor will be validated after field descriptor removal.\n\nname (String) - schema field name\n(errors.TableSchemaError) - raises any error occured in the process\n(Field/null) - returns removed Field instances or null if not found\n\nschema.castRow(row)\nCast row based on field types and formats.\n\nrow (any[]) - data row as an array of values\n(any[]) - returns cast data row\n\nschema.infer(rows, {headers=1})\nInfer and set schema.descriptor based on data sample.\n\nrows (Array[]) - array of arrays representing rows.\nheaders (Integer/String[]) - data sample headers (one of):\nrow number containing headers (rows should contain headers rows)\narray of headers (rows should NOT contain headers rows)\n\n\n{Object} - returns Table Schema descriptor\n\nschema.commit({strict})\nUpdate schema instance if there are in-place changes in the descriptor.\n\nstrict (Boolean) - alter strict mode for further work\n(errors.TableSchemaError) - raises any error occured in the process\n(Boolean) - returns true on success and false if not modified\n\nconst descriptor = {fields: [{name: 'field', type: 'string'}]}\nconst schema = await Schema.load(descriptor)\n\nschema.getField('name').type // string\nschema.descriptor.fields[0].type = 'number'\nschema.getField('name').type // string\nschema.commit()\nschema.getField('name').type // number\n\nasync schema.save(target)\nSave schema descriptor to target destination.\n\ntarget (String) - path where to save a descriptor\n(errors.TableSchemaError) - raises any error occured in the process\n(Boolean) - returns true on success\n\n1.3.3. Field\nClass represents field in the schema.\nData values can be cast to native Javascript types. Casting a value will check the value is of the expected type, is in the correct format, and complies with any constraints imposed by a schema.\n{\n    'name': 'birthday',\n    'type': 'date',\n    'format': 'default',\n    'constraints': {\n        'required': True,\n        'minimum': '2015-05-30'\n    }\n}\n\nFollowing code will not raise the exception, despite the fact our date is less than minimum constraints in the field, because we do not check constraints of the field descriptor\nvar dateType = field.castValue('2014-05-29')\n\nAnd following example will raise exception, because we set flag 'skip constraints' to false, and our date is less than allowed by minimum constraints of the field. Exception will be raised as well in situation of trying to cast non-date format values, or empty values\ntry {\n    var dateType = field.castValue('2014-05-29', false)\n} catch(e) {\n    // uh oh, something went wrong\n}\n\nValues that can't be cast will raise an Error exception.\nCasting a value that doesn't meet the constraints will raise an Error exception.\nAvailable types, formats and resultant value of the cast:\n\n\n\nType\nFormats\nCasting result\n\n\n\n\nany\ndefault\nAny\n\n\narray\ndefault\nArray\n\n\nboolean\ndefault\nBoolean\n\n\ndate\ndefault, any, \nDate\n\n\ndatetime\ndefault, any, \nDate\n\n\nduration\ndefault\nmoment.Duration\n\n\ngeojson\ndefault, topojson\nObject\n\n\ngeopoint\ndefault, array, object\n[Number, Number]\n\n\ninteger\ndefault\nNumber\n\n\nnumber\ndefault\nNumber\n\n\nobject\ndefault\nObject\n\n\nstring\ndefault, uri, email, binary\nString\n\n\ntime\ndefault, any, \nDate\n\n\nyear\ndefault\nNumber\n\n\nyearmonth\ndefault\n[Number, Number]\n\n\n\nnew Field(descriptor, {missingValues=['']})\nConstructor to instantiate Field class.\n\ndescriptor (Object) - schema field descriptor\nmissingValues (String[]) - an array with string representing missing values\n(errors.TableSchemaError) - raises any error occured in the process\n(Field) - returns field class instance\n\nfield.name\n\n(String) - returns field name\n\nfield.type\n\n(String) - returns field type\n\nfield.format\n\n(String) - returns field format\n\nfield.required\n\n(Boolean) - returns true if field is required\n\nfield.constraints\n\n(Object) - returns an object with field constraints\n\nfield.descriptor\n\n(Object) - returns field descriptor\n\nfield.castValue(value, {constraints=true})\nCast given value according to the field type and format.\n\nvalue (any) - value to cast against field\nconstraints (Boolean/String[]) - gets constraints configuration\nit could be set to true to disable constraint checks\nit could be an Array of constraints to check e.g. ['minimum', 'maximum']\n\n\n(errors.TableSchemaError) - raises any error occured in the process\n(any) - returns cast value\n\nfield.testValue(value, {constraints=true})\nTest if value is compliant to the field.\n\nvalue (any) - value to cast against field\nconstraints (Boolean/String[]) - constraints configuration\n(Boolean) - returns if value is compliant to the field\n\n1.3.4. Validate\n\nvalidate() validates whether a schema is a validate Table Schema accordingly to the specifications. It does not validate data against a schema.\n\nGiven a schema descriptor validate returns Promise with a validation object:\nconst {validate} = require('tableschema')\n\nconst {valid, errors} = await validate('schema.json')\nfor (const error of errors) {\n  // inspect Error objects\n}\n\nasync validate(descriptor)\nThis funcion is async so it has to be used with await keyword or as a Promise.\n\ndescriptor (String/Object) - schema descriptor (one of):\nlocal path\nremote url\nobject\n\n\n(Object) - returns {valid, errors} object\n\n1.3.5. Infer\nGiven data source and headers infer will return a Table Schema as a JSON object based on the data values.\nGiven the data file, example.csv:\nid,age,name\n1,39,Paul\n2,23,Jimmy\n3,36,Jane\n4,28,Judy\n\nCall infer with headers and values from the datafile:\nconst descriptor = await infer('data.csv')\n\nThe descriptor variable is now a JSON object:\n{\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'id',\n      title: '',\n      description: '',\n      type: 'integer',\n      format: 'default'\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'age',\n      title: '',\n      description: '',\n      type: 'integer',\n      format: 'default'\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'name',\n      title: '',\n      description: '',\n      type: 'string',\n      format: 'default'\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nasync infer(source, {headers=1, ...options})\nThis funcion is async so it has to be used with await keyword or as a Promise.\n\nsource (String/Array[]/Stream/Function) - data source (one of):\nlocal CSV file (path)\nremote CSV file (url)\narray of arrays representing the rows\nreadable stream with CSV file contents\nfunction returning readable stream with CSV file contents\n\n\nheaders (String[]) - array of headers\noptions (Object) - any Table.load options\n(errors.TableSchemaError) - raises any error occured in the process\n(Object) - returns schema descriptor\n\n1.3.6. Errors\nerrors.TableSchemaError\nBase class for the all library errors. If there are more than one error you could get an additional information from the error object:\ntry {\n  // some lib action\n} catch (error) {\n  console.log(error) // you have N cast errors (see error.errors)\n  if (error.multiple) {\n    for (const error of error.errors) {\n        console.log(error) // cast error M is ...\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nerrors.tableSchemaError.rowNumber\n\n(Number/undefined) - row number of the error if available\n\nerrors.tableSchemaError.columnNumber\n\n(Number/undefined) - column number of the error if available\n\n1.4.

Updating the local schemas cache1. datapackage-rb\n\n\n\n\n\nA ruby library for working with Data Packages.\nThe library is intending to support:\n\nParsing and using data package metadata and data\nValidating data packages to ensure they conform with the Data Package specification\n\n1.1. Installation\nAdd the gem into your Gemfile:\ngem 'datapackage.rb'\nOr:\ngem install datapackage\n1.2. Reading a Data Package\nRequire the gem, if you need to:\nrequire 'datapackage'\n\nParsing a data package descriptor from a remote location:\npackage = DataPackage::Package.new( \"http://example.org/datasets/a/datapackage.json\" )\n\nThis assumes that http://example.org/datasets/a/datapackage.json exists.\nSimilarly you can load a package descriptor from a local JSON file.\npackage = DataPackage::Package.new( \"/my/data/package/datapackage.json\" )\n\nThe data package descriptor\ni.e. datapackage.json file, is expected to be at the root directory\nof the data package and the path attribute of the package's resources will be resolved\nrelative to it.\nYou can also load a data package descriptor directly from a Hash:\n descriptor = {\n  'resources'=> [\n    {\n      'name'=> 'example',\n      'profile'=> 'tabular-data-resource',\n      'data'=> [\n        ['height', 'age', 'name'],\n        ['180', '18', 'Tony'],\n        ['192', '32', 'Jacob'],\n      ],\n      'schema'=>  {\n        'fields'=> [\n          {'name'=> 'height', 'type'=> 'integer'},\n          {'name'=> 'age', 'type'=> 'integer'},\n          {'name'=> 'name', 'type'=> 'string'},\n        ],\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\npackage = DataPackage::Package.new(descriptor)\n\nThere are a set of helper methods for accessing data from the package, e.g:\npackage.name\npackage.title\npackage.description\npackage.homepage\npackage.license\n\n1.3. Reading Data Resources\nA data package must contain an array of Data Resources.\nYou can access the resources in your Data Package either by their name or by their index in the resources array:\nfirst_resource = package.resources[0]\nfirst_resource = package.get_resource('example')\n\n# Get info about the data source of this resource\nfirst_resource.inline?\nfirst_resource.local?\nfirst_resource.remote?\nfirst_resource.multipart?\nfirst_resource.tabular?\nfirst_resource.source\n\nYou can then read the source depending on its type. For example if resource is local and not multipart it could by open as a file: File.open(resource.source).\nIf a resource complies with the Tabular Data Resource spec or uses the\ntabular-data-resource profile you can read resource rows:\nresoure = package.resources[0]\nresource.tabular?\nresource.headers\nresource.schema\n\n# Read the the whole rows at once\ndata = resource.read\ndata = resource.read(keyed: true)\n\n# Or iterate through it\ndata = resource.iter {|row| print row}\n\nSee TableSchema documentation for other things you can do with tabular resource.\n1.4. Creating a Data Package\npackage = DataPackage::Package.new\n\n# Add package properties\npackage.name = 'my_sleep_duration'\n\n# Add a resource\npackage.add_resource(\n  {\n    'name'=> 'sleep_durations_this_week',\n    'data'=> [7, 8, 5, 6, 9, 7, 8],\n  }\n)\n\nIf the resource is valid it will be added to the resources array of the Data Package;\nif it's invalid it will not be added and you should try creating and validating your resource to see why it fails.\n# Update a resource\nmy_resource = package.get_resource('sleep_durations_this_week')\nmy_resource['schema'] = {\n  'fields'=> [\n    {'name'=> 'number_hours', 'type'=> 'integer'},\n  ]\n}\n\n# Save the Data Package descriptor to the target file\npackage.save('datapackage.json')\n\n# Remove a resource\npackage.remove_resource('sleep_durations_this_week')\n\n1.5. Profiles\nData Package and Data Resource descriptors can be validated against  JSON schemas that we call profiles.\nBy default, this gem uses the standard Data Package profile and Data Resource profile but alternative profiles are available for both.\nAccording to the specs the value of\nthe profile property can be either a URL or an indentifier from the registry.\n1.5.1. Profiles in the local cache\nThe profiles from the registry come bundled with the gem. You can reference them in your Data Package descriptor by their identifier in the registry:\n\ndata-package the default profile for a Data Package\ndata-resource the default profile for a Data Resource\ntabular-data-package for a Tabular Data Package\ntabular-data-resource for a Tabular Data Resource\nfiscal-data-package for a Fiscal Data Package\n\n{\n  \"profile\": \"tabular-data-package\"\n}\n\n1.5.2. Profiles from elsewhere\nIf you have a custom profile schema you can reference it by its URL:\n{\n  \"profile\": \"https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/schemas/tabular-data-package.json\"\n}\n\n1.6. Validation\nData Resources and Data Packages are validated against their profiles to ensure they respect the expected structure.\n1.6.1. Validating a Resource\ndescriptor = {\n  'name'=> 'incorrect name',\n  'path'=> 'https://cdn.rawgit.com/frictionlessdata/datapackage-rb/master/spec/fixtures/test-pkg/test.csv',\n}\nresource = DataPackage::Resource.new(descriptor, base_path='')\n\n# Returns true if resource is valid, false otherwise\nresource.valid?\n\n# Returns true or raises DataPackage::ValidationError\nresource.validate\n\n# Iterate through validation errors\nresource.iter_errors{ |err| p err}\n\n1.6.2. Validating a Package\nThe same methods used to check the validity of a Resource - valid?, validate and iter_errors- are also available for a Package.\nThe difference is that after a Package descriptor is validated against its profile, each of its resources are also validated against their profile.\nIn order for a Package to be valid all its Resources have to be valid.\n1.7. Developer notes\nThese notes are intended to help people that want to contribute to this package itself. If you just want to use it, you can safely ignore them.\nAfter checking out the repo, run bundle to install dependencies. Then, run rake spec to run the tests.\nTo install this gem onto your local machine, run bundle exec rake install.\nTo release a new version, update the version number in version.rb, and then run bundle exec rake release,\nwhich will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the .gem file to rubygems.org.\n1.7.1. Updating the local schemas cache\nWe cache the local schemas from https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/schemas/registry.json.\nThe local schemas should be kept up to date with the remote ones using:\nrake update_profiles\n"},"sources/tableschema-rb.html":{"url":"sources/tableschema-rb.html","title":"tableschema-rb","keywords":"","body":"1. tableschema-rb1.1.

Installation\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\ngem 'tableschema'\n\nAnd then execute:\n$ bundle\nOr install it yourself as:\n$ gem install tableschema\n1.1.1. Update from jsontableschema\nThe library and its corresponding gem was previously called jsontableschema.\nSince version 0.3 the library was renamed tableschema and has a gem with the same name.\nThe gem jsontableschema is no longer maintained. Here are the steps to transition your code to tableschema:\n\nReplace\n gem 'jsontableschema'\n\n with\n gem 'tableschema', '0.3.0'\n\n\nReplace module name JsonTableSchema with module name TableSchema. For example:\n JsonTableSchema::Table.new(source, schema: schema)\n\n with\n TableSchema::Table.new(source, schema: schema)\n\n\n\n1.2. Usage\n1.2.1. Parse a CSV\nValidate and cast data from a CSV as described by a schema.\nschema = {\n    fields: [\n        {\n            name: 'id',\n            title: 'Identifier',\n            type: 'integer'\n        },\n        {\n            name: 'title',\n            title: 'Title',\n            type: 'string'\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nsource = 'https://github.com/frictionlessdata/tableschema-rb/raw/master/spec/fixtures/simple_data.csv'\n\ntable = TableSchema::Table.new(source, schema: schema)\n\n# Iterate through rows\ntable.iter{ |row| print row }\n# [1, \"foo\"]\n# [2, \"bar\"]\n# [3, \"baz\"]\n\n# Read the entire CSV in memory\ntable.read\n#=> [[1,'foo'],[2,'bar'],[3,'baz']]\n\nBoth iter and read take the optional parameters:\n\nkeyed: boolean, default: false - return the rows as Hashes with headers as keys\ncast: boolean, default true - cast values for each row\nlimit: integer, default nil - stop at this many rows\n\n1.2.2. Infer a schema\nIf you don't have a schema for a CSV, and want to generate one, you can infer a schema like so:\nsource = 'https://github.com/frictionlessdata/tableschema-rb/raw/master/spec/fixtures/simple_data.csv' # Can also be a url or array of arrays\n\ntable = TableSchema::Table.new(source)\ntable.infer()\ntable.schema\n#=> {:fields=>[{:name=>\"id\", :title=>\"\", :description=>\"\", :type=>\"integer\", :format=>\"default\", :constraints=>{}}, {:name=>\"title\", :title=>\"\", :description=>\"\", :type=>\"string\", :format=>\"default\", :constraints=>{}}]}\n\n1.2.3. Build a Schema\nYou can also build a schema from scratch or modify an existing one:\nschema = TableSchema::Schema.new({\n  fields: [],\n})\n\n# Add a field\nschema.add_field({\n  name: 'id',\n  type: 'string',\n  constraints: {\n    required: true,\n  }\n})\n\n# Remove a field\nschema.remove_field('id')\n\nadd_field will ignore the updates if the updated version of the the schema fails validation.\nIf you wish to prevent an invalid schema from being created or updated by raising validation errors, you can pass the strict: true argument to the Schema initializer:\nschema = TableSchema::Schema.new(schema_hash, strict: true)\n\nThere are multiple methods to inspect a schema:\nschema_hash = {\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'id',\n      type: 'string',\n      constraints: {\n        required: true,\n      },\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'height',\n      type: 'number',\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'state',\n    },\n  ],\n  primaryKey: 'id',\n  foreignKeys: [\n    {\n      fields: 'state',\n      reference: {\n          resource: 'the-resource',\n          fields: 'state_id',\n      },\n    },\n  ]\n}\nschema = TableSchema::Schema.new(schema_hash)\n\nschema.field_names\n#=> [\"id\", \"height\"]\nschema.fields\n#=> [{:name=>\"id\", :type=>\"string\", :constraints=>{:required=>true}, :format=>\"default\"}, {:name=>\"height\", :type=>\"number\", :format=>\"default\", :constraints=>{}}]\nschema.primary_key\n#=> [\"id\"]\nschema.foreign_keys\n# => [{:fields=>\"state\", :reference=>{:resource=>\"the-resource\", :fields=>\"state_id\"}}]\nschema.get_field('id')\n# => {:name=>\"id\", :type=>\"string\", :constraints=>{:required=>true}, :format=>\"default\"}\n\nCast row\nTo check if a given set of values complies with the schema, you can use cast_row:\nschema.cast_row(['string', '10.0', 'State'])\n#=> ['string', 10.0, 'State']\nBy default the converter will fail on the first error it finds. However, by passing fail_fast: false as the second argument the errors will be collected into an exception.errors attribute for you to review later. For example:\nrow = [3, 'nan', 'State']\n\nschema.cast_row(row)\n#=> TableSchema::InvalidCast: 3 is not a string\nbegin\n  schema.cast_row(row, fail_fast: false)\nrescue TableSchema::MultipleInvalid => exception\n  exception.errors\nend\n#=> #,\n            #}>\n\n1.2.4. Validate a schema\nTo make sure a schema complies with Table Schema spec, we validate each custom schema against the\nofficial Table Schema schema:\nschema_hash = {\n  fields: [\n      { name: 'id' },\n  ]\n}\nschema = TableSchema::Schema.new(schema_hash)\nschema.validate\n#=> true\n\nIf the schema is invalid, you can access the errors via the errors attribute\nschema_hash = {\n  fields: [\n    {\n      name: 'id',\n      title: 'Identifier',\n      type: 'integer'\n    },\n    {\n      name: 'title',\n      title: 'Title',\n      type: 'string'\n    }\n  ],\n  primaryKey: 'identifier'\n}\n\nschema = TableSchema::Schema.new(schema_hash)\nschema.validate\n#=> false\nschema.errors\n#=> #\n\n# Raise error if validation fails\nschema.validate!\n#=> TableSchema::SchemaException: The TableSchema primaryKey value `identifier` is not found in any of the schema's field names\n\n1.3. Field\nData values can be cast to native Ruby objects with a Field instance. This allows formats and constraints to be defined for the field in the field descriptor:\n# Init field\nfield = TableSchema::Field.new({\n  name: 'over_1700',\n  type: 'number',\n  constraints: {\n    minimum: '1700',\n  },\n})\n\n# Cast a value\nfield.cast_value('12345')\n#=> 12345.0\n\nCasting a value will check the value is of the expected type, is in the correct format, and complies with any constraints imposed in the descriptor.\nValue that can't be cast will raise an InvalidCast exception.\nCasting a value that doesn't meet the constraints will raise a ConstraintError exception.\nfield.cast_value('nan')\n#=> TableSchema::InvalidCast: nan is not a number\nfield.cast_value('1200')\n#=> TableSchema::ConstraintError: The field `over_1700` must not be less than 1700\n\n1.4.

Install\n$ go get -u github.com/frictionlessdata/datapackage-go/...\n\n1.2. Main Features\n1.2.1. Loading and validating data package descriptors\nA data package is a collection of resources. The datapackage.Package provides various capabilities like loading local or remote data package, saving a data package descriptor and many more.\nConsider we have some local csv file and a JSON descriptor in a data directory:\n\ndata/population.csv\ncity,year,population\nlondon,2017,8780000\nparis,2017,2240000\nrome,2017,2860000\n\ndata/datapackage.json\n{\n    \"name\": \"world\",\n    \"resources\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"population\",\n        \"path\": \"population.csv\",\n        \"profile\":\"tabular-data-resource\",\n        \"schema\": {\n          \"fields\": [\n            {\"name\": \"city\", \"type\": \"string\"},\n            {\"name\": \"year\", \"type\": \"integer\"},\n            {\"name\": \"population\", \"type\": \"integer\"}\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n\n\nLet's create a data package based on this data using the datapackage.Package class:\npkg, err := datapackage.Load(\"data/datapackage.json\")\n// Check error.\n\n1.2.2. Accessing data package resources\nOnce the data package is loaded, we could use the datapackage.Resource class to read data resource's contents:\nresource := pkg.GetResource(\"population\")\ncontents, _ := resource.ReadAll()\nfmt.Println(contents)\n// [[london 2017 8780000] [paris 2017 2240000] [rome 20172860000]]\n\nOr you could cast to Go types, making it easier to perform further processing:\ntype Population struct {\n    City string `tableheader:\"city\"`\n    Year  string `tableheader:\"year\"`\n    Population   int    `tableheader:\"population\"`\n}\n\nvar cities []Population\nresource.Cast(&cities, csv.LoadHeaders())\nfmt.Printf(\"+v\", cities)\n// [{City:london Year:2017 Population:8780000} {City:paris Year:2017 Population:2240000} {City:rome Year:2017 Population:2860000}]\n\nFinally, if the data is to big to be loaded at once or if you would like to perform line-by-line processing, you could iterate through the resource contents:\niter, _ := resource.Iter(csv.LoadHeaders())\nsch, _ := resource.GetSchema()\nfor iter.Next() {\n    var p Population\n    sch.CastRow(iter.Row(), &cp)\n    fmt.Printf(\"%+v\\n\", p)\n}\n// {City:london Year:2017 Population:8780000\n// {City:paris Year:2017 Population:2240000}\n// {City:rome Year:2017 Population:2860000}]\n\n1.2.3. Loading zip bundles\nIt is very common to store the data in zip bundles containing the descriptor and data files. Those are natively supported by our the datapackage.Load method. For example, lets say we have the following package.zip bundle:\n|- package.zip\n    |- datapackage.json\n    |- data.csv\nWe could load this package by simply:\npkg, err := datapackage.Load(\"package.zip\")\n// Check error.\n\nAnd the library will unzip the package contents to a temporary directory and wire everything up for us.\nA complete example can be found here.\n1.2.4. Creating a zip bundle with the data package.\nYou could also easily create a zip file containing the descriptor and all the data resources. Let's say you have a datapackage.Package instance, to create a zip file containing all resources simply:\nerr := pkg.Zip(\"package.zip\")\n// Check error.\n\nThis call also download remote resources. A complete example can be found here\n1.2.5. CSV dialect support\nBasic support for configuring CSV dialect has been added. In particular delimiter, skipInitialSpace and header fields are supported. For instance, lets assume the population file has a different field delimiter:\n\ndata/population.csv\ncity,year,population\nlondon;2017;8780000\nparis;2017;2240000\nrome;2017;2860000\n\n\nOne could easily parse by adding following dialect property to the world resource:\n    \"dialect\":{\n        \"delimiter\":\";\"\n    }\n\nA complete example can be found here.\n1.2.6. Loading multipart resources\nSometimes you have data scattered across many local or remote files. Datapackage-go offers an easy way you to deal all those file as one big\nfile. We call it multipart resources. To use this feature, simply list your files in the path property of the resource. For example, lets\nsay our population data is now split between north and south hemispheres. To deal with this, we only need change to change the package descriptor:\n\ndata/datapackage.json\n{\n    \"name\": \"world\",\n    \"resources\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"population\",\n        \"path\": [\"north.csv\",\"south.csv\"],\n        \"profile\":\"tabular-data-resource\",\n        \"schema\": {\n          \"fields\": [\n            {\"name\": \"city\", \"type\": \"string\"},\n            {\"name\": \"year\", \"type\": \"integer\"},\n            {\"name\": \"population\", \"type\": \"integer\"}\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n\n\nAnd all the rest of the code would still be working. \nA complete example can be found here.\n1.2.7. Manipulating data packages programatically\nThe datapackage-go library also makes it easy to save packages. Let's say you're creating a program that produces data packages and would like to add or remove resource:\ndescriptor := map[string]interface{}{\n    \"resources\": []interface{}{\n        map[string]interface{}{\n            \"name\":    \"books\",\n            \"path\":    \"books.csv\",\n            \"format\":  \"csv\",\n            \"profile\": \"tabular-data-resource\",\n            \"schema\": map[string]interface{}{\n                \"fields\": []interface{}{\n                    map[string]interface{}{\"name\": \"author\", \"type\": \"string\"},\n                    map[string]interface{}{\"name\": \"title\", \"type\": \"string\"},\n                    map[string]interface{}{\"name\": \"year\", \"type\": \"integer\"},\n                },\n            },\n        },\n    },\n}\npkg, err := datapackage.New(descriptor, \".\", validator.InMemoryLoader())\nif err != nil {\n    panic(err)\n}\n// Removing resource.\npkg.RemoveResource(\"books\")\n\n// Adding new resource.\npkg.AddResource(map[string]interface{}{\n    \"name\":    \"cities\",\n    \"path\":    \"cities.csv\",\n    \"format\":  \"csv\",\n    \"profile\": \"tabular-data-resource\",\n    \"schema\": map[string]interface{}{\n        \"fields\": []interface{}{\n            map[string]interface{}{\"name\": \"city\", \"type\": \"string\"},\n            map[string]interface{}{\"name\": \"year\", \"type\": \"integer\"},\n            map[string]interface{}{\"name\": \"population\", \"type\": \"integer\"}\n        },\n    },\n})\n\n// Printing resource contents.\ncities, _ := pkg.GetResource(\"cities\").ReadAll()\nfmt.Println(cities)\n// [[london 2017 8780000] [paris 2017 2240000] [rome 20172860000]]\n\n"},"sources/tableschema-go.html":{"url":"sources/tableschema-go.html","title":"tableschema-go","keywords":"","body":"1. tableschema-go2.

Using dep\n$ dep init\n$ dep ensure -add github.com/frictionlessdata/tableschema-go/csv@>=0.1\n\n3. Main Features\n3.1. Tabular Data Load\nHave tabular data stored in local files? Remote files? Packages like the csv are going to help on loading the data you need and making it ready for processing. \npackage main\n\nimport \"github.com/frictionlessdata/tableschema-go/csv\"\n\nfunc main() {\n   tab, err := csv.NewTable(csv.Remote(\"myremotetable\"), csv.LoadHeaders())\n   // Error handling.\n}\n\nSupported physical representations:\n\nCSV\n\nYou would like to use tableschema-go but the physical representation you use is not listed here? No problem! Please create an issue before start contributing. We will be happy to help you along the way.\n3.2. Schema Inference and Configuration\nGot that new dataset and wants to start getting your hands dirty ASAP? No problems, let the schema package try to infer\nthe data types based on the table data.\npackage main\n\nimport (\n   \"github.com/frictionlessdata/tableschema-go/csv\"\n   \"github.com/frictionlessdata/tableschema-go/schema\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n   tab, _ := csv.NewTable(csv.Remote(\"myremotetable\"), csv.LoadHeaders())\n   sch, _ := schema.Infer(tab)\n   fmt.Printf(\"%+v\", sch)\n}\n\n\nWant to go faster? Please give InferImplicitCasting a try and let us know how it goes.\n\nThere might be cases in which the inferred schema is not correct. One of those cases is when your data use strings like \"N/A\" to represent missing cells. That would usually make our inferential algorithm think the field is a string.\nWhen that happens, you can manually perform those last minutes tweaks Schema.\n   sch.MissingValues = []string{\"N/A\"}\n   sch.GetField(\"ID\").Type = schema.IntegerType\n\nAfter all that, you could persist your schema to disk:\nsch.SaveToFile(\"users_schema.json\")\n\nAnd use the local schema later:\nsch, _ := sch.LoadFromFile(\"users_schema.json\")\n\nFinally, if your schema is saved remotely, you can also use it:\nsch, _ := schema.LoadRemote(\"http://myfoobar/users/schema.json\")\n\n3.3. Processing Tabular Data\nOnce you have the data, you would like to process using language data types. schema.CastTable and schema.CastRow are your friends on this journey.\npackage main\n\nimport (\n   \"github.com/frictionlessdata/tableschema-go/csv\"\n   \"github.com/frictionlessdata/tableschema-go/schema\"\n)\n\ntype user struct {\n   ID   int\n   Age  int\n   Name string\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n   tab, _ := csv.NewTable(csv.FromFile(\"users.csv\"), csv.LoadHeaders())\n   sch, _ := schema.Infer(tab)\n   var users []user\n   sch.CastTable(tab, &users)\n   // Users slice contains the table contents properly raw into\n   // language types. Each row will be a new user appended to the slice.\n}\n\nIf you have a lot of data and can no load everything in memory, you can easily iterate trough it:\n...\n   iter, _ := sch.Iter()\n   for iter.Next() {\n      var u user\n      sch.CastRow(iter.Row(), &u)\n      // Variable u is now filled with row contents properly raw\n      // to language types.\n   }\n...\n\n\nEven better if you could do it regardless the physical representation! The table package declares some interfaces that will help you to achieve this goal:\n\n\nTable\nIterator\n\n3.3.1. Field\nClass represents field in the schema.\nFor example, data values can be castd to native Go types. Decoding a value will check if the value is of the expected type, is in the correct format, and complies with any constraints imposed by a schema.\n{\n    'name': 'birthday',\n    'type': 'date',\n    'format': 'default',\n    'constraints': {\n        'required': True,\n        'minimum': '2015-05-30'\n    }\n}\n\nThe following example will raise exception the passed-in is less than allowed by minimum constraints of the field. Errors will be returned as well when the user tries to cast values which are not well formatted dates.\ndate, err := field.Cast(\"2014-05-29\")\n// uh oh, something went wrong\n\nValues that can't be castd will return an error.\nCasting a value that doesn't meet the constraints will return an error.\nAvailable types, formats and resultant value of the cast:\n\n\n\nType\nFormats\nCasting result\n\n\n\n\nany\ndefault\ninterface{}\n\n\nobject\ndefault\ninterface{}\n\n\narray\ndefault\n[]interface{}\n\n\nboolean\ndefault\nbool\n\n\nduration\ndefault\ntime.Time\n\n\ngeopoint\ndefault, array, object\n[float64, float64]\n\n\ninteger\ndefault\nint64\n\n\nnumber\ndefault\nfloat64\n\n\nstring\ndefault, uri, email, binary\nstring\n\n\ndate\ndefault, any, \ntime.Time\n\n\ndatetime\ndefault, any, \ntime.Time\n\n\ntime\ndefault, any, \ntime.Time\n\n\nyear\ndefault\ntime.Time\n\n\nyearmonth\ndefault\ntime.Time\n\n\n\n3.4. Saving Tabular Data\nOnce you're done processing the data, it is time to persist results. As an example, let us assume we have a remote table schema called summary, which contains two fields:\n\nDate: of type date\nAverageAge: of type number \n\nimport (\n   \"github.com/frictionlessdata/tableschema-go/csv\"\n   \"github.com/frictionlessdata/tableschema-go/schema\"\n)\n\n\ntype summaryEntry struct {\n    Date time.Time\n    AverageAge float64\n}\n\nfunc WriteSummary(summary []summaryEntry, path string) {\n   sch, _ := schema.LoadRemote(\"http://myfoobar/users/summary/schema.json\")\n\n   f, _ := os.Create(path)\n   defer f.Close()\n\n   w := csv.NewWriter(f)\n   defer w.Flush()\n\n   w.Write([]string{\"Date\", \"AverageAge\"})\n   for _, summ := range summary{\n       row, _ := sch.UncastRow(summ)\n       w.Write(row)\n   }\n}\n\n4.

Parse a CSV without a Schema\nCast data from a CSV without a schema:\nURL url = new URL(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frictionlessdata/tableschema-java/master/src/test/resources/fixtures/simple_data.csv\");\nTable table = new Table(url);\n\n// Iterate through rows          \nTableIterator iter = table.iterator();\nwhile(iter.hasNext()){\n    Object[] row = iter.next();\n    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(row));\n}\n\n// [1, foo]\n// [2, bar]\n// [3, baz]\n\n// Read the entire CSV and output it as a List:\nList allData = table.read();\n\n1.1.2. Write a Table Into a File\nYou can write a Table into a CSV file:\nURL url = new URL(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frictionlessdata/tableschema-java/master/src/test/resources/fixtures/simple_data.csv\");\nTable table = new Table(url);\ntable.write(\"/path/to/write/table.csv\");\n\n1.1.3. Build a Schema\nYou can build a Schema instance from scratch or modify an existing one:\nSchema schema = new Schema();\n\nField nameField = new Field(\"name\", Field.FIELD_TYPE_STRING);\nschema.addField(nameField);\n\nField coordinatesField = new Field(\"coordinates\", Field.FIELD_TYPE_GEOPOINT);\nschema.addField(coordinatesField);\n\nSystem.out.println(schema.getJson());\n\n// {\"fields\":[{\"name\":\"name\",\"format\":\"default\",\"description\":\"\",\"type\":\"string\",\"title\":\"\",\"constraints\":{}},{\"name\":\"coordinates\",\"format\":\"default\",\"description\":\"\",\"type\":\"geopoint\",\"title\":\"\",\"constraints\":{}}]}\n\nYou can also build a Schema instance with JSONObject instances instead of Field instances:\nSchema schema = new Schema(); // By default strict=false validation\n\nJSONObject nameFieldJsonObject = new JSONObject();\nnameFieldJsonObject.put(\"name\", \"name\");\nnameFieldJsonObject.put(\"type\", Field.FIELD_TYPE_STRING);\nschema.addField(nameFieldJsonObject);\n\n// Because strict=false, an invalid Field definition will be included.\n// The error will be logged/tracked in the error list schema.getErrors().\nJSONObject invalidFieldJsonObject = new JSONObject();\ninvalidFieldJsonObject.put(\"name\", \"id\");\ninvalidFieldJsonObject.put(\"type\", Field.FIELD_TYPE_INTEGER);\ninvalidFieldJsonObject.put(\"format\", \"invalid\");\nschema.addField(invalidFieldJsonObject);\n\nJSONObject coordinatesFieldJsonObject = new JSONObject();\ncoordinatesFieldJsonObject.put(\"name\", \"coordinates\");\ncoordinatesFieldJsonObject.put(\"type\", Field.FIELD_TYPE_GEOPOINT);\ncoordinatesFieldJsonObject.put(\"format\", Field.FIELD_FORMAT_ARRAY);\nschema.addField(coordinatesFieldJsonObject);\n\nSystem.out.println(schema.getJson());\n\n// {\"fields\":[{\"name\":\"name\",\"format\":\"default\",\"description\":\"\",\"type\":\"string\",\"title\":\"\",\"constraints\":{}},{\"name\":\"id\",\"format\":\"invalid\",\"description\":\"\",\"type\":\"integer\",\"title\":\"\",\"constraints\":{}},{\"name\":\"coordinates\",\"format\":\"array\",\"description\":\"\",\"type\":\"geopoint\",\"title\":\"\",\"constraints\":{}}]}\n\nWhen using the addField method, the schema undergoes validation after every field addition.\nIf adding a field causes the schema to fail validation, then the field is automatically removed.\nAlternatively, you might want to build your Schema by loading the schema definition from a JSON file:\nString schemaFilePath = \"/path/to/schema/file/shema.json\";\nSchema schema = new Schema(schemaFilePath, true); // enforce validation with strict=true.\n\n1.1.4. Infer a Schema\nIf you don't have a schema for a CSV and don't want to manually define one then you can generate it:\nURL url = new URL(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frictionlessdata/tableschema-java/master/src/test/resources/fixtures/simple_data.csv\");\nTable table = new Table(url);\n\nSchema schema = table.inferSchema();\nSystem.out.println(schema.getJson());\n\n// {\"fields\":[{\"name\":\"id\",\"format\":\"\",\"description\":\"\",\"title\":\"\",\"type\":\"integer\",\"constraints\":{}},{\"name\":\"title\",\"format\":\"\",\"description\":\"\",\"title\":\"\",\"type\":\"string\",\"constraints\":{}}]}\n\nThe type inferral algorithm tries to cast to available types and each successful type casting increments a popularity score for the successful type cast in question. At the end, the best score so far is returned.\nThe inferral algorithm traverses all of the table's rows and attempts to cast every single value of the table. When dealing with large tables, you might want to limit the number of rows that the inferral algorithm processes:\n// Only process the first 25 rows for type inferral.\nSchema schema = table.inferSchema(25);\n\nIf List data and String[] headers are available, the schema can also be inferred from the a Schema object:\nJSONObject inferredSchema = schema.infer(data, headers);\n\nRow limit can also be set:\nJSONObject inferredSchema = schema.infer(data, headers, 25);\n\nUsing an instance of Table or Scheme to infer a schema invokes the same method from the TypeInferred Singleton:\nTypeInferrer.getInstance().infer(data, headers, 25);\n\n1.1.5. Write a Schema Into a File:\nYou can write a Schema into a JSON file:\nSchema schema = new Schema();\n\nField nameField = new Field(\"name\", Field.FIELD_TYPE_STRING);\nschema.addField(nameField);\n\nField coordinatesField = new Field(\"coordinates\", Field.FIELD_TYPE_GEOPOINT);\nschema.addField(coordinatesField);\n\nschema.write(\"/path/to/write/schema.json\");\n\n1.1.6. Parse a CSV with a Schema\nIf you have a schema, you can input it as parameter when creating the Table instance so that the data from the CSV will be cast into the field types defined in the schema:\n// Let's start by defining and building the schema of a table that contains data on employees:\nSchema schema = new Schema();\n\nField idField = new Field(\"id\", Field.FIELD_TYPE_INTEGER);\nschema.addField(idField);\n\nField nameField = new Field(\"name\", Field.FIELD_TYPE_STRING);\nschema.addField(nameField);\n\nField dobField = new Field(\"dateOfBirth\", Field.FIELD_TYPE_DATE); \nschema.addField(dobField);\n\nField isAdminField = new Field(\"isAdmin\", Field.FIELD_TYPE_BOOLEAN);\nschema.addField(isAdminField);\n\nField addressCoordinatesField = new Field(\"addressCoordinates\", Field.FIELD_TYPE_GEOPOINT, Field.FIELD_FORMAT_OBJECT);\nschema.addField(addressCoordinatesField);\n\nField contractLengthField = new Field(\"contractLength\", Field.FIELD_TYPE_DURATION);\nschema.addField(contractLengthField);\n\nField infoField = new Field(\"info\", Field.FIELD_TYPE_OBJECT);\nschema.addField(infoField);\n\n// Load the data from URL with the schema.\nURL url = new URL(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frictionlessdata/tableschema-java/master/src/test/resources/fixtures/employee_data.csv\");\nTable table = new Table(url, schema);\n\nTableIterator iter = table.iterator();\nwhile(iter.hasNext()){\n\n    // The fetched array will contain row values that have been cast into their\n    // appropriate types as per field definitions in the schema.\n    Object[] row = iter.next();\n\n    int id = (int)row[0];\n    String name = (String)row[1];\n    DateTime dob = (DateTime)row[2];\n    boolean isAdmin = (boolean)row[3];\n    int[] addressCoordinates = (int[])row[4];\n    Duration contractLength = (Duration)row[5];\n    JSONObject info = (JSONObject)row[6];\n}\n\n1.1.7. Validate a Schema\nTo make sure a schema complies with Table Schema specifications, we can validate each custom schema against the official Table Schema schema:\nJSONObject schemaJsonObj = new JSONObject();\nField nameField = new Field(\"id\", Field.FIELD_TYPE_INTEGER);\nschemaJsonObj.put(\"fields\", new JSONArray());\nschemaJsonObj.getJSONArray(\"fields\").put(nameField.getJson());\n\nSchema schema = new Schema(schemaJsonObj);\n\nboolean isValid = schema.validate();\nSystem.out.println(isValid);\n\n// true\n\nField invalidField = new Field(\"coordinates\", \"invalid\");\nschemaJsonObj.getJSONArray(\"fields\").put(invalidField.getJson());\n\nisValid = schema.validate();\nSystem.out.println(isValid);\n\n// false\n\n1.2. Setting Primary Key\n1.2.1. Single Key\nSchema schema = new Schema();\n\nField idField = new Field(\"id\", Field.FIELD_TYPE_INTEGER);\nschema.addField(idField);\n\nField nameField = new Field(\"name\", Field.FIELD_TYPE_STRING);\nschema.addField(nameField);\n\nschema.setPrimaryKey(\"id\");\n\n1.2.2. Composite Key\nSchema schema = new Schema();\n\nField idField = new Field(\"id\", Field.FIELD_TYPE_INTEGER);\nschema.addField(idField);\n\nField nameField = new Field(\"name\", Field.FIELD_TYPE_STRING);\nschema.addField(nameField);\n\nField surnameField = new Field(\"surname\", Field.FIELD_TYPE_STRING);\nschema.addField(surnameField);\n\nschema.setPrimaryKey(new String[]{\"name\", \"surname\"});\nString[] compositeKey = schema.getPrimaryKey();\n\n1.3. Casting\n1.3.1. Row Casting\nTo check if a given set of values complies with the schema, you can use castRow:\nSchema schema = new Schema();\n\n// A String field.\nField stringField = new Field(\"stringField\", Field.FIELD_TYPE_STRING);\nschema.addField(stringField);\n\n// An Integer field.\nField integerField = new Field(\"integerField\", Field.FIELD_TYPE_INTEGER);\nschema.addField(integerField);\n\n// A Boolean field.\nField booleanField = new Field(\"booleanField\", Field.FIELD_TYPE_BOOLEAN);\nschema.addField(booleanField);\n\n// Define a given set of values:\nString[] row = new String[]{\"John Doe\", \"25\", \"T\"}\n\n// Cast the row's values into their schema defined types: \nObject[] castRow = schema.castRow(row);\n\nIf a value in the given set of values cannot be cast to its expected type as defined by the schema, then an InvalidCastException is thrown.\n1.3.2. Field Casting\nData values can be cast to native Java objects with a Field instance. This allows formats and constraints to be defined for the field in the field descriptor:\nField intField = new Field(\"id\", Field.FIELD_TYPE_INTEGER);\nint intVal = intField.castValue(\"242\");\nSystem.out.print(intVal);\n\n// 242\n\nField datetimeField = new Field(\"date\", Field.FIELD_TYPE_DATETIME);\nDateTime datetimeVal = datetimeField.castValue(\"2008-08-30T01:45:36.123Z\");\nSystem.out.print(datetimeVal.getYear());\n\n// 2008\n\nField geopointField = new Field(\"coordinates\", Field.FIELD_TYPE_GEOPOINT, Field.FIELD_FORMAT_ARRAY);\nint[] geopointVal = geopointField.castValue(\"[12,21]\");\nSystem.out.print(\"lon: \" + geopointVal[0] + \", lat: \" + geopointVal[1]);\n\n// lon: 12, lat: 21\n\nCasting a value will check the value is of the expected type, is in the correct format, and complies with any constraints imposed in the descriptor.\nValue that can't be cast will raise an InvalidCastException.\nBy default, casting a value that does not meet the constraints will raise a ConstraintsException.\nConstraints can be ignored with by setting a boolean flag to false:\n// Define constraint limiting String length between 30 and 40 characters:\nMap constraints = new HashMap();\nconstraints.put(Field.CONSTRAINT_KEY_MIN_LENGTH, 30);\nconstraints.put(Field.CONSTRAINT_KEY_MAX_LENGTH, 40);\n\n// Cast a field and cast a value that violates the above constraint.\n// Disable constrain enforcement by setting the enforceConstraints boolean flag to false.\nField field = new Field(\"name\", Field.FIELD_TYPE_STRING, null, null, null, constraints);\nfield.castValue(\"This string length is greater than 45 characters.\", false); // Setting false here ignores constraints during cast.\n\n// ConstraintsException will not be thrown despite casting a value that does not meet the constraints.\n\nYou can call the checkConstraintViolations method to find out which constraints are being validated.\nThe method returns a map of violated constraints:\nMap constraints = new HashMap();\nconstraints.put(Field.CONSTRAINT_KEY_MINIMUM, 5);\nconstraints.put(Field.CONSTRAINT_KEY_MAXIMUM, 15);\n\nField field = new Field(\"name\", Field.FIELD_TYPE_INTEGER, null, null, null, constraints);\n\nint constraintViolatingValue = 16;\nMap violatedConstraints = field.checkConstraintViolations(constraintViolatingValue);\n\nSystem.out.println(violatedConstraints);\n\n// {maximum=15}\n\n1.4. Infer Type\nThe Field class' castValue used the TypeInferrer singleton to cast the given value into the desired type.\nFor instance, you can use the TypeInferrer singleton to cast a String representation of a number into a float like so:\nMap options = new HashMap();\noptions.put(\"bareNumber\", false);\noptions.put(\"groupChar\", \" \");\noptions.put(\"decimalChar\", \",\");\nfloat num = (float)TypeInferrer.getInstance().castNumber(Field.FIELD_FORMAT_DEFAULT, \"1 564,123 EUR\", options);\n\n1.5.

Documentation\nThe package is still under development and some properties may not be working properly.\nJson objects are not included in R base data types. Jsonlite package is internally used to convert json data to list objects. The input parameters of functions could be json strings, files or lists and the outputs are in list format to easily further process your data in R environment and exported as desired. The examples below show how to use jsonlite package to convert the output back to json adding indentation whitespace. More details about handling json you can see jsonlite documentation or vignettes here.\n5.1. Package\nA class for working with data packages. It provides various capabilities like loading local or remote data package, inferring a data package descriptor, saving a data package descriptor and many more.\nConsider we have some local csv files in a data directory. Let's create a data package based on this data using a Package class:\n\ninst/data/cities.csv\n\ncity,location\nlondon,\"51.50,-0.11\"\nparis,\"48.85,2.30\"\nrome,\"41.89,12.51\"\n\n\ninst/data/population.csv\n\ncity,year,population\nlondon,2017,8780000\nparis,2017,2240000\nrome,2017,2860000\n\nFirst we create a blank data package::\ndataPackage = Package.load()\n\nNow we're ready to infer a data package descriptor based on data files we have. Because we have two csv files we use glob pattern *.csv:\ndataPackage$infer('**.csv')\ndataPackage$descriptor\n\nAn infer method has found all our files and inspected it to extract useful metadata like profile, encoding, format, Table Schema etc. Let's tweak it a little bit:\n#dataPackage$descriptor$resources[1]$schema$fields[1]$type = 'year'\ndataPackage$commit()\ndataPackage$valid # true\n\nBecause our resources are tabular we could read it as a tabular data:\ndataPackage$getResource('population')$read( keyed = TRUE ) \n\n# [ { city: 'london', year: 2017, population: 8780000 },\n#   { city: 'paris', year: 2017, population: 2240000 },\n#   { city: 'rome', year: 2017, population: 2860000 } ]\n\nLet's save our descriptor on the disk. After it we could update our datapackage.json as we want, make some changes etc:\ndataPackage.save('datapackage.json')\n\nTo continue the work with the data package we just load it again but this time using local datapackage.json:\ndataPackage = Package.load('datapackage.json')\n# Continue the work\n\nIt was onle basic introduction to the Package class. To learn more let's take a look on Package class API reference.\nPackage.load(descriptor, basePath, strict=FALSE)\nConstructor to instantiate Package class.\n\ndescriptor (String/Object) - data package descriptor as local path, url or object\nbasePath (String) - base path for all relative paths\nstrict (Boolean) - strict flag to alter validation behavior. Setting it to TRUE leads to throwing errors on any operation with invalid descriptor\n(errors.DataPackageError) - raises error if something goes wrong\n(Package) - returns data package class instance\n\npackage$valid\n\n(Boolean) - returns validation status. It always true in strict mode.\n\npackage$errors\n\n(Error[]) - returns validation errors. It always empty in strict mode.\n\npackage$profile\n\n(Profile) - returns an instance of Profile class (see below).\n\npackage$descriptor\n\n(Object) - returns data package descriptor\n\npackage$resources\n\n(Resource[]) - returns an list of Resource instances (see below).\n\npackage$resourceNames\n\n(String[]) - returns an list of resource names.\n\npackage$getResource(name)\nGet data package resource by name.\n\nname (String) - data resource name\n(Resource/null) - returns Resource instances or null if not found\n\npackage$addResource(descriptor)\nAdd new resource to data package. The data package descriptor will be validated with newly added resource descriptor.\n\ndescriptor (Object) - data resource descriptor\n(errors$DataPackageError) - raises error if something goes wrong\n(Resource/null) - returns added Resource instance or null if not added\n\npackage$removeResource(name)\nRemove data package resource by name. The data package descriptor will be validated after resource descriptor removal.\n\nname (String) - data resource name\n(errors$DataPackageError) - raises error if something goes wrong\n(Resource/null) - returns removed Resource instances or null if not found\n\npackage$infer(pattern=FALSE)\nInfer a data package metadata. If pattern is not provided only existent resources will be inferred (added metadata like encoding, profile etc). If pattern is provided new resoures with file names mathing the pattern will be added and inferred. It commits changes to data package instance.\n\npattern (String) - glob pattern for new resources\n(Object) - returns data package descriptor\n\npackage$commit(strict)\nUpdate data package instance if there are in-place changes in the descriptor.\n\nstrict (Boolean) - alter strict mode for further work\n(errors$DataPackageError) - raises error if something goes wrong\n(Boolean) - returns true on success and false if not modified\n\ndataPackage = Package.load('{\n    \"name\": \"package\",\n    \"resources\": [{\"name\": \"resource\", \"data\": [\"data\"]}]\n}')\n\ndataPackage$descriptor$name # package\n\n## [1] \"package\"\ndataPackage$descriptor$name = 'renamed-package'\ndataPackage$commit()\n\n## [1] TRUE\ndataPackage$descriptor$name # renamed-package\n\n## [1] \"renamed-package\"\npackage.save(target)\n\nFor now only descriptor will be saved.\n\nSave data package to target destination.\n\ntarget (String) - path where to save a data package\n(errors$DataPackageError) - raises error if something goes wrong\n(Boolean) - returns true on success\n\n5.1.1. Resource\nA class for working with data resources. You can read or iterate tabular resources using the iter/read methods and all resource as bytes using rowIter/rowRead methods.\nConsider we have some local csv file. It could be inline data or remote link - all supported by Resource class (except local files for in-brower usage of course). But say it's data.csv for now:\ncity,location\nlondon,\"51.50,-0.11\"\nparis,\"48.85,2.30\"\nrome,N/A\n\nLet's create and read a resource. We use static Resource$load method instantiate a resource. Because resource is tabular we could use resourceread method with a keyed option to get an array of keyed rows:\nresource = Resource.load('{\"path\": \"data.csv\"}')\nresource$tabular# TRUE\n\n## [1] TRUE\n#resource$headers # ['city', 'location']\n#resource$read(keyed = TRUE)\n\n# [\n#   {city: 'london', location: '51.50,-0.11'},\n#   {city: 'paris', location: '48.85,2.30'},\n#   {city: 'rome', location: 'N/A'},\n# ]\n\nAs we could see our locations are just a strings. But it should be geopoints. Also Rome's location is not available but it's also just a N/A string instead of JavaScript null. First we have to infer resource metadata:\nresource$infer()\nresource$descriptor\n#{ path: 'data.csv',\n#  profile: 'tabular-data-resource',\n#  encoding: 'utf-8',\n#  name: 'data',\n#  format: 'csv',\n#  mediatype: 'text/csv',\n# schema: { fields: [ [Object], [Object] ], missingValues: [ '' ] } }\nresource$read( keyed = TRUE )\n# Fails with a data validation error\n\nLet's fix not available location. There is a missingValues property in Table Schema specification. As a first try we set missingValues to N/A in resource$descriptor.schema. Resource descriptor could be changed in-place but all changes should be commited by resource$commit():\nresource$descriptor$schema$missingValues = 'N/A'\nresource$commit()\nresource$valid # FALSE\nresource$errors\n# Error: Descriptor validation error:\n#   Invalid type: string (expected array)\n#    at \"/missingValues\" in descriptor and\n#    at \"/properties/missingValues/type\" in profile\n\nAs a good citiziens we've decided to check out recource descriptor validity. And it's not valid! We should use an array for missingValues property. Also don't forget to have an empty string as a missing value:\nresource$descriptor$schema[['missingValues']] = list('', 'N/A')\nresource$commit()\nresource$valid # TRUE\n\nAll good. It looks like we're ready to read our data again:\nresource$read( keyed = TRUE )\n# [\n#   {city: 'london', location: [51.50,-0.11]},\n#   {city: 'paris', location: [48.85,2.30]},\n#   {city: 'rome', location: null},\n# ]\n\nNow we see that: - locations are arrays with numeric lattide and longitude - Rome's location is a native JavaScript null\nAnd because there are no errors on data reading we could be sure that our data is valid againt our schema. Let's save our resource descriptor:\nresource$save('dataresource.json')\n\nLet's check newly-crated dataresource.json. It contains path to our data file, inferred metadata and our missingValues tweak:\n{\n    \"path\": \"data.csv\",\n    \"profile\": \"tabular-data-resource\",\n    \"encoding\": \"utf-8\",\n    \"name\": \"data\",\n    \"format\": \"csv\",\n    \"mediatype\": \"text/csv\",\n    \"schema\": {\n        \"fields\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"city\",\n                \"type\": \"string\",\n                \"format\": \"default\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"name\": \"location\",\n                \"type\": \"geopoint\",\n                \"format\": \"default\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"missingValues\": [\n            \"\",\n            \"N/A\"\n        ]\n    }\n}\n\nIf we decide to improve it even more we could update the dataresource.json file and then open it again using local file name:\nresource = Resource.load('dataresource.json')\n# Continue the work\n\nIt was onle basic introduction to the Resource class.

Foreign Keys\nThe library supports foreign keys described in the Table Schema specification. It means if your data package descriptor use resources[]$schema$foreignKeys property for some resources a data integrity will be checked on reading operations.\nConsider we have a data package:\nDESCRIPTOR = '{\n  \"resources\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"teams\",\n      \"data\": [\n        [\"id\", \"name\", \"city\"],\n        [\"1\", \"Arsenal\", \"London\"],\n        [\"2\", \"Real\", \"Madrid\"],\n        [\"3\", \"Bayern\", \"Munich\"]\n      ],\n      \"schema\": {\n        \"fields\": [\n          {\"name\": \"id\", \"type\": \"integer\"},\n          {\"name\": \"name\", \"type\": \"string\"},\n          {\"name\": \"city\", \"type\": \"string\"}\n        ],\n        \"foreignKeys\": [\n          {\n            \"fields\": \"city\",\n            \"reference\": {\"resource\": \"cities\", \"fields\": \"name\"}\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }, {\n      \"name\": \"cities\",\n      \"data\": [\n        [\"name\", \"country\"],\n        [\"London\", \"England\"],\n        [\"Madrid\", \"Spain\"]\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}'\n\nLet's check relations for a teams resource:\npackage = Package.load(DESCRIPTOR)\n# teams = package$getResource('teams')\n# teams$checkRelations()\n# tableschema.exceptions.RelationError: Foreign key \"['city']\" violation in row \"4\"\n\nAs we could see there is a foreign key violation. That's because our lookup table cities doesn't have a city of Munich but we have a team from there. We need to fix it in cities resource:\npackage$descriptor[['resources']][1]['data']$push(['Munich', 'Germany'])\npackage$commit()\nteams = package$getResource('teams')\nawait teams$checkRelations()\n# TRUE\n\nFixed! But not only a check operation is available. We could use relations argument for resource$iter/read methods to dereference a resource relations:\nteams$read('{\"keyed\": true, \"relations\": true}')\n#[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Arsenal', 'city': {'name': 'London', 'country': 'England}},\n# {'id': 2, 'name': 'Real', 'city': {'name': 'Madrid', 'country': 'Spain}},\n# {'id': 3, 'name': 'Bayern', 'city': {'name': 'Munich', 'country': 'Germany}}]\n\nInstead of plain city name we've got a dictionary containing a city data.

Load library\n# load the library using\nlibrary(tableschema.r)\n\n5. Documentation\nThe package is still under development and some properties may not be working properly. Json objects are not included in R base data types. Jsonlite package is internally used to convert json data to list objects. The input parameters of functions could be json strings, files or lists and the outputs are in list format to easily further process your data in R environment and exported as desired. The examples below show how to use jsonlite package to convert the output back to json adding indentation whitespace. More details about handling json you can see jsonlite documentation or vignettes here.\nMoreover future package is also used to load and create Table and Schema class asynchronously. To retrieve the actual result of the loaded Table or Schema you have to call $value() to the variable you stored the loaded Table/Schema. More details about future package and sequential and parallel processing you can find here.\n5.1. Table\nA table is a core concept in a tabular data world. It represents a data with a metadata (Table Schema). Let's see how we could use it in practice.\nConsider we have some local csv file. It could be inline data or remote link - all supported by Table class (except local files for in-brower usage of course). But say it's data.csv for now:\n\ndata/cities.csv\n\ncity,location\nlondon,\"51.50,-0.11\"\nparis,\"48.85,2.30\"\nrome,N/A\n\nLet's create and read a table. We use static Table.load method and table.read method with a keyed option to get array of keyed rows:\ndef = Table.load('inst/extdata/data.csv')\ntable = def$value()\ntable.headers = table$headers # ['city', 'location']\n\njsonlite::toJSON(table$read(keyed = TRUE), pretty = TRUE) # add indentation whitespace to JSON output with jsonlite\n\n## [\n##   {\n##     \"city\": [\"london\"],\n##     \"location\": [\"\\\"51.50\"],\n##     \"3\": [\"-0.11\\\"\"]\n##   },\n##   {\n##     \"city\": [\"paris\"],\n##     \"location\": [\"\\\"48.85\"],\n##     \"3\": [\"2.30\\\"\"]\n##   },\n##   {\n##     \"city\": [\"rome\"],\n##     \"location\": [\"N/A\"]\n##   }\n## ]\nAs we could see our locations are just a strings. But it should be geopoints. Also Rome's location is not available but it's also just a N/A string instead of JavaScript null. First we have to infer Table Schema:\njsonlite::toJSON(table$infer(), pretty = TRUE) # add indentation whitespace to JSON output with jsonlite\n\n## {\n##   \"fields\": [\n##     {\n##       \"name\": [\"city\"],\n##       \"type\": [\"string\"],\n##       \"format\": [\"default\"]\n##     },\n##     {\n##       \"name\": [\"location\"],\n##       \"type\": [\"string\"],\n##       \"format\": [\"default\"]\n##     }\n##   ],\n##   \"missingValues\": [\"list()\"]\n## }\njsonlite::toJSON(table$schema$descriptor, pretty = TRUE)\n\n## {\n##   \"fields\": [\n##     {\n##       \"name\": [\"city\"],\n##       \"type\": [\"string\"],\n##       \"format\": [\"default\"]\n##     },\n##     {\n##       \"name\": [\"location\"],\n##       \"type\": [\"string\"],\n##       \"format\": [\"default\"]\n##     }\n##   ],\n##   \"missingValues\": [\"list()\"]\n## }\ntable$read(keyed = TRUE) # Fails\n\n## Error: Row dimension doesn't match schema's fields dimension\nLet's fix not available location. There is a missingValues property in Table Schema specification. As a first try we set missingValues to N/A in table.schema.descriptor. Schema descriptor could be changed in-place but all changes sould be commited by table.schema.commit():\ntable$schema$descriptor['missingValues'] = 'N/A'\ntable$schema$commit()\n\n## [1] TRUE\ntable$schema$valid # false\n\n## [1] FALSE\ntable$schema$errors\n\n## [[1]]\n## [1] \"Descriptor validation error:\\n            data.missingValues - is the wrong type\"\nAs a good citiziens we've decided to check out schema descriptor validity. And it's not valid! We sould use an array for missingValues property. Also don't forget to have an empty string as a missing value:\ntable$schema$descriptor[['missingValues']] = list(\"\", \"NA\")\ntable$schema$commit()\n\n## [1] TRUE\ntable$schema$valid # true\n\n## [1] TRUE\nAll good. It looks like we're ready to read our data again:\ntable$read(keyed = TRUE)\n# [\n#   {city: 'london', location: [51.50,-0.11]},\n#   {city: 'paris', location: [48.85,2.30]},\n#   {city: 'rome', location: null},\n# ]\n\nNow we see that: - locations are arrays with numeric lattide and longitude - Rome's location is a native JavaScript null\nAnd because there are no errors on data reading we could be sure that our data is valid againt our schema. Let's save it:\ntable$schema$save('schema.json')$value()\ntable$save('data.csv')\n\nOur data.csv looks the same because it has been stringified back to csv format. But now we have schema.json:\n{\n    \"fields\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"city\",\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"format\": \"default\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"location\",\n            \"type\": \"geopoint\",\n            \"format\": \"default\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"missingValues\": [\n        \"\",\n        \"N/A\"\n    ]\n}\n\nIf we decide to improve it even more we could update the schema file and then open it again. But now providing a schema path.\ndef = Table.load('inst/extdata/data.csv', schema = 'inst/extdata/schema.json')\ntable = def$value()\ntable\n\n## \n##   Public:\n##     clone: function (deep = FALSE) \n##     headers: active binding\n##     infer: function (limit = 100) \n##     initialize: function (src, schema = NULL, strict = FALSE, headers = 1) \n##     iter: function (keyed, extended, cast = TRUE, relations = FALSE, stream = FALSE) \n##     read: function (keyed = FALSE, extended = FALSE, cast = TRUE, relations = FALSE, \n##     save: function (connection) \n##     schema: active binding\n##   Private:\n##     createRowStream_: function (src) \n##     createUniqueFieldsCache: function (schema) \n##     currentStream_: NULL\n##     headers_: NULL\n##     headersRow_: 1\n##     rowNumber_: 0\n##     schema_: Schema, R6\n##     src: inst/extdata/data.csv\n##     strict_: FALSE\n##     uniqueFieldsCache_: list\nIt was onle basic introduction to the Table class. To learn more let's take a look on Table class API reference.\nTable.load(source, schema, strict=FALSE, headers=1, ...)\nConstructor to instantiate Table class.

Schema\n5.2.1. Schema\nA model of a schema with helpful methods for working with the schema and supported data. Schema instances can be initialized with a schema source as a url to a JSON file or a JSON object. The schema is initially validated (see validate below). By default validation errors will be stored in schema$errors but in a strict mode it will be instantly raised.\nLet's create a blank schema. It's not valid because descriptor$fields property is required by the Table Schema specification:\ndef = Schema.load({})\nschema = def$value()\nschema$valid # false\n\n## [1] FALSE\nschema$errors\n\n## [[1]]\n## [1] \"Descriptor validation error:\\n            data.fields - is required\"\nTo do not create a schema descriptor by hands we will use a schema$infer method to infer the descriptor from given data:\njsonlite::toJSON(\n  schema$infer(helpers.from.json.to.list('[\n    [\"id\", \"age\", \"name\"],\n    [\"1\",\"39\",\"Paul\"],\n    [\"2\",\"23\",\"Jimmy\"],\n    [\"3\",\"36\",\"Jane\"],\n    [\"4\",\"28\",\"Judy\"]\n    ]')), pretty = TRUE)\n\n## {\n##   \"fields\": [\n##     {\n##       \"name\": [\"id\"],\n##       \"type\": [\"integer\"]\n##     },\n##     {\n##       \"name\": [\"age\"],\n##       \"type\": [\"integer\"]\n##     },\n##     {\n##       \"name\": [\"name\"],\n##       \"type\": [\"string\"]\n##     }\n##   ]\n## }\nschema$valid # true\n\n## [1] TRUE\njsonlite::toJSON(\n  schema$descriptor, \n  pretty = TRUE)\n\n## {\n##   \"fields\": [\n##     {\n##       \"name\": [\"id\"],\n##       \"type\": [\"integer\"],\n##       \"format\": [\"default\"]\n##     },\n##     {\n##       \"name\": [\"age\"],\n##       \"type\": [\"integer\"],\n##       \"format\": [\"default\"]\n##     },\n##     {\n##       \"name\": [\"name\"],\n##       \"type\": [\"string\"],\n##       \"format\": [\"default\"]\n##     }\n##   ],\n##   \"missingValues\": [\"list()\"]\n## }\nNow we have an inferred schema and it's valid. We could cast data row against our schema. We provide a string input by an output will be cast correspondingly:\njsonlite::toJSON(\n  schema$castRow(helpers.from.json.to.list('[\"5\", \"66\", \"Sam\"]')),\n  pretty = TRUE, auto_unbox = TRUE)\n\n## [\n##   5,\n##   66,\n##   \"Sam\"\n## ]\nBut if we try provide some missing value to age field cast will fail because for now only one possible missing value is an empty string. Let's update our schema:\nschema$castRow(helpers.from.json.to.list('[\"6\", \"N/A\", \"Walt\"]'))\n\n## Error in schema$castRow(helpers.from.json.to.list(\"[\\\"6\\\", \\\"N/A\\\", \\\"Walt\\\"]\")): There are 1 cast errors (see following - Wrong type for header: age and value: N/A\n# Cast error\nschema$descriptor$missingValues = list('', 'N/A')\nschema$commit()\n\n## [1] TRUE\nschema$castRow(helpers.from.json.to.list('[\"6\", \"N/A\", \"Walt\"]'))\n# [ 6, null, 'Walt' ]\n\nWe could save the schema to a local file. And we could continue the work in any time just loading it from the local file:\nschema$save('schema.json')$value()\nschema = Schema.load('schema.json')\n\nIt was onle basic introduction to the Schema class. To learn more let's take a look on Schema class API reference.\nSchema.load(descriptor, strict=FALSE)\nFactory method to instantiate Schema class. This method is async and it should be used with $value() keyword.\n\ndescriptor (String/Object) - schema descriptor:\nlocal path\nremote url\nobject\nstrict (Boolean) - flag to alter validation behaviour:\nif false error will not be raised and all error will be collected in schema$errors\nif strict is true any validation error will be raised immediately\n(errors$TableSchemaError) - raises any error occured in the process\n(Schema) - returns schema class instance\n\nschema$valid\n\n(Boolean) - returns validation status.

Field\nClass represents field in the schema.\nData values can be cast to native R types. Casting a value will check the value is of the expected type, is in the correct format, and complies with any constraints imposed by a schema.\n{\n    \"name\": \"birthday\",\n    \"type\": \"date\",\n    \"format\": \"default\",\n    \"constraints\": {\n        \"required\": true,\n        \"minimum\": \"2015-05-30\"\n    }\n}\n\nFollowing code will not raise the exception, despite the fact our date is less than minimum constraints in the field, because we do not check constraints of the field descriptor\nfield = Field$new(helpers.from.json.to.list('{\"name\": \"name\", \"type\": \"number\"}'))\ndateType = field$cast_value('12345') # cast\ndateType # print the result\n\n## [1] 12345\nAnd following example will raise exception, because we set flag 'skip constraints' to false, and our date is less than allowed by minimum constraints of the field. Exception will be raised as well in situation of trying to cast non-date format values, or empty values\ntryCatch (\n    dateType = field$cast_value('2014-05-29', FALSE), \n    error = function(e){# uh oh, something went wrong\n    })\n\n## Error in private$castValue(...): Field character(0) can't cast value 2014-05-29 for type number with format default\nValues that can't be cast will raise an Error exception. Casting a value that doesn't meet the constraints will raise an Error exception.\nTable below shows the available types, formats and resultant value of the cast:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nFormats\nCasting result\n\n\n\n\nany\ndefault\nAny\n\n\narray\ndefault\nArray\n\n\nboolean\ndefault\nBoolean\n\n\ndate\ndefault, any\nDate\n\n\ndatetime\ndefault, any\nDate\n\n\nduration\ndefault\nDuration\n\n\ngeojson\ndefault, topojson\nObject\n\n\ngeopoint\ndefault, list, object\n[Number, Number]\n\n\ninteger\ndefault\nNumber\n\n\nnumber\ndefault\nNumber\n\n\nobject\ndefault\nObject\n\n\nstring\ndefault, uri, email, binary\nString\n\n\ntime\ndefault, any\nDate\n\n\nyear\ndefault\nNumber\n\n\nyearmonth\ndefault\n[Number, Number]\n\n\n\n\nField$new(descriptor, missingValues=[''])\n(Field$new will change to Field.load)\nConstructor to instantiate Field class.\n\ndescriptor (Object) - schema field descriptor\nmissingValues (String[]) - an array with string representing missing values\n(errors.TableSchemaError) - raises any error occured in the process\n(Field) - returns field class instance\n\nfield$name\n\n(String) - returns field name\n\nfield$type\n\n(String) - returns field type\n\nfield$format\n\n(String) - returns field format\n\nfield$required\n\n(Boolean) - returns true if field is required\n\nfield$constraints\n\n(Object) - returns an object with field constraints\n\nfield$descriptor\n\n(Object) - returns field descriptor\n\nfield$cast_value(value, constraints=TRUE)\nCast given value according to the field type and format.\n\nvalue (any) - value to cast against field\nconstraints (Boolean/String[]) - gets constraints configuration\nit could be set to true to disable constraint checks\nit could be a List of constraints to check e.g. ['minimum', 'maximum']\n(errors$TableSchemaError) - raises any error occured in the process\n(any) - returns cast value\n\nfield$testValue(value, constraints=TRUE)\nTest if value is compliant to the field.\n\nvalue (any) - value to cast against field\nconstraints (Boolean/String[]) - constraints configuration\n(Boolean) - returns if value is compliant to the field\n\n5.3.1. Validate\n\nvalidate() validates whether a schema is a validate Table Schema accordingly to the specifications. It does not validate data against a schema.\n\nGiven a schema descriptor validate returns a validation object:\nvalid_errors = validate('inst/extdata/schema.json')\nvalid_errors\n\n## $valid\n## [1] TRUE\n## \n## $errors\n## list()\nvalidate(descriptor)\nValidate a Table Schema descriptor.\n\ndescriptor (String/Object) - schema descriptor (one of):\nlocal path\nremote url\nobject\n(Object) - returns {valid, errors} object\n\n5.3.2.

TableSchema.jl\n\n\n\n\n\nA library for working with Table Schema in Julia:\n\nTable Schema is a simple language- and implementation-agnostic way to declare a schema for tabular data. Table Schema is well suited for use cases around handling and validating tabular data in text formats such as CSV, but its utility extends well beyond this core usage, towards a range of applications where data benefits from a portable schema format.\n\nFeatures\n\nTable class for working with data and schema\nSchema class for working with schemata\nField class for working with schema fields\nvalidate function for validating schema descriptors\ninfer function that creates a schema based on a data sample\n\nStatus\n:construction: This package is pre-release and under heavy development. Please see DESIGN.md for a detailed overview of our goals, and visit the issues page to contribute and make suggestions. For questions that need to a real time response, reach out via Gitter. Thanks! :construction:\n2. Usage\nWe aim to make this library compatible with all widely used approaches to work with tabular data in Julia.\nPlease visit our wiki for a list of related projects that we are tracking, and contibute use cases there or as enhancement issues.\nSee examples folder and unit tests in runtests.jl for current usage.\n2.1. Table\nfilestream = os.open(\"cities.csv\")\ntable = Table(filestream)\ntable.headers\n# ['city', 'location']\ntable.read(keyed=True)\n# [\n#   {city: 'london', location: '51.50,-0.11'},\n#   {city: 'paris', location: '48.85,2.30'},\n#   {city: 'rome', location: 'N/A'},\n# ]\nrows = table.source\n# 6×5 Array{Any,2}:\n#   \"id\"    \"height\"   \"age\"  \"name\"     \"occupation\"         \n#  1      10.0        1       \"string1\"  \"2012-06-15 00:00:00\"\n#  2      10.1        2       \"string2\"  \"2013-06-15 01:00:00\"\n# ...\nerr = table.errors # handle errors\n...\n\n2.2. Schema\nusing TableSchema\n\nfilestream = os.open(\"schema.json\")\nschema = Schema(filestream)\nschema.fields\n# \nerr = schema.errors # handle errors\n\n2.3. Field\nAdd fields to create or expand your schema like this:\nschema = Schema()\nfield = Field()\nfield.descriptor._name = \"A column\"\nfield.descriptor.typed = \"Integer\"\nadd_field(schema, field)\n\n2.4. Installation\n:construction: Work In Progress. The following documentation is relevant only after package release.\nThe package use semantic versioning, meaning that major versions could include breaking changes. It is highly recommended to specify a version range in your REQUIRE file e.g.:\nv\"1.0-\" At the Julia REPL, install the package as usual with:\nPkg.add(\"TableSchema\")\n\nCode examples here require Julia 0.6+.\n2.5. Development\nClone this repository, then see the test folder for test sources and mock data.\nFrom your console, you can run the unit tests with:\njulia -L src/TableSchema.jl test/runtests.jl\nYou should see a test summary displayed.\nAlternatively, put include(\"src/TableSchema.jl\") in your IDE's console before running runtests.jl.\n"}}}
