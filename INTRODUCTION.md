# FrictionlessData Developer Hub


Welcome to the FrictionlessData Developer Hub!

## Overview

> If you're not a developer please visit https://frictionlessdata.io/

Frictionless Data shortens the path from data to insight with a collection of specifications and software for the publication, transport, and consumption of data. At the heart of our approach is a deep understanding of the multi-faceted nature of data work, and an emphasis on platform-agnostic interoperability. From consumer spreadsheet software, through to cloud-based services for data analysis, the future of data is frictionless.

## Implement

All getting started/tutorial code snippets should be multilanguage like this:
